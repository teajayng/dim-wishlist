Chroma Rush is one of the many beautiful new weapons available in S14. It&amp;rsquo;s a 720 RPM Rapid-Fire Frame Auto Rifle; the only available in the game apart from Arctic Haze.

Ehroar &amp;ldquo;The most important weapon to get this season that will be relevant in the PvE meta for some time&amp;rdquo; Frostbolt &amp;ldquo;This thing is horrifying. It&amp;rsquo;s going to remind you of The Mountaintop It&amp;rsquo;s like a full-auto GL!&amp;quot; Well, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure the world of players will get as much utility out of this in PvP as Frostbolt does, but you will definitely make magic with it inside of PvE.</description></item><item><title>Shattered Cipher</title><link>https://www.sliflist.com/docs/14/shattered_cipher/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sliflist.com/docs/14/shattered_cipher/</guid><description>For complete perks, see d2gunsmith.com, light.gg or destinytracker.com.
