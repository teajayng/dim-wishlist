High-Impact (360 RPM) frame Solar Machine Gun. I don&amp;rsquo;t see this being useful in PvE since it won&amp;rsquo;t be your pick for big DPS or ad clear and relatively situational in PvP.

Bite of the Fox is a Kinetic-slot, Aggressive Frame sniper. It&amp;rsquo;s been in the Iron Banner loot pool since Season 4 and has been re-issued in Season 11. This means if you had a BOTF, it will hit the level cap this season, so you&amp;rsquo;ll want to get a new roll to take you past Season 11.
PvP Thoughts Aggressive Frame snipers are the only ones that can one-shot every super in the Crucible.</description></item><item><title>Crimil's Dagger</title><link>https://www.sliflist.com/docs/ib/crimils_dagger/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sliflist.com/docs/ib/crimils_dagger/</guid><description>For complete perks, see d2gunsmith.com, light.gg or destinytracker.com.
Crimil&amp;rsquo;s is a 110 RPM Kinetic, Aggressive Frame Hand Cannon that has been re-issued in Season 11 with a higher power cap. It features the same perk pool its always had and since 110s haven&amp;rsquo;t been touched over the years dince Destiny 2&amp;rsquo;s launch, it&amp;rsquo;s going to be a pretty limited set of perks we&amp;rsquo;re interested in.

Fool&amp;rsquo;s Remedy is &amp;ldquo;SUROS Rapid-Fire&amp;rdquo; (i.e. fully automatic) 450 RPM Sidearm that has been re-issued in Season 11&amp;rsquo;s Iron Banner. The Remedy is the only SUROS-RF sidearm in the game apart from Dead Man Walking.
If you&amp;rsquo;re going to chase a single weapon from Season 11 Iron Banner (thus far), the Fool&amp;rsquo;s Remedy is the one to go for. People are raving about it because of how it performs at base, its available perks, and that those perks now include the new Iron Banner specific perks: Iron Gaze and Iron Grip.</description></item><item><title>Forge's Pledge</title><link>https://www.sliflist.com/docs/ib/forges_pledge/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sliflist.com/docs/ib/forges_pledge/</guid><description>For complete perks, see d2gunsmith.com, light.gg or destinytracker.com.

Orewing&amp;rsquo;s Maul is a Lightweight Frame, 90RPM Void Grenade Launcher. Orewing&amp;rsquo;s is almost identical to the Truthteller in every way, though it has a materially different (and less excellent) perk pool. Truthteller has more interesting combinations, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean Orewing&amp;rsquo;s can&amp;rsquo;t put in work!
Like Truthteller, Orewing&amp;rsquo;s is part of the &amp;ldquo;Lightweight Frame&amp;rdquo; grenade launchers (breach-loaded, single shot). Lightweight grenade launchers all have a &amp;ldquo;remote detonation&amp;rdquo; ability where they detonate when you release the trigger (or you get a direct hit).</description></item><item><title>Peacebond</title><link>https://www.sliflist.com/docs/ib/peacebond/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.sliflist.com/docs/ib/peacebond/</guid><description>For complete perks, see d2gunsmith.com, light.gg or destinytracker.com.
