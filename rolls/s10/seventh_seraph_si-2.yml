    These rolls aren't super tight on the Barrel and Magazine front
    because they aren't going to dramatically alter the value of the
    overall roll. Vorpal is really the key here. Without Vorpal, you're
    better off using the better-rolled Anonymous Autumn as mentioned
    above. Otherwise we're going for +Range and +Stability wherever we
    can get it.

    The SI-2 is the only sidearm in the game that can roll with both
    Demolitionist and Dragonfly. That's exciting because Demolitionist
    counts the Dragonfly collateral kills towards getting your grenade
    back. Don't forget the `Dragonfly Spec` mod from Ada-1!

    When sidearms are up in the seasonal artifact, this is a solid choice!

    Like Grave Robber and Swashbuckler, these two perks play super well
    off each other. If you love sidearms, considering adding this to your
    collection. You'll do some serious damage during Seraph Tower events.
