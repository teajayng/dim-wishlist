    With other Guardians at your side, you will rip through hordes of aliens no
    problem. We're taking any Barrel that increases Stability and magazine-
    extending... Magazines. Extended Magazine would normally be a hot mess with
    a base `Reload` so low, but with Field Prep it only takes the reload from 
    `~3.5s` to `~4.5s` (still 1s shorter than the base `Reload`).
