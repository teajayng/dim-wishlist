    Any basic roll will chew up Guardians with a lot of flinch. Let's add
    `Range` and `Stability` where we can, while seeing what `Opening Shot`
    can do.

    With other Guardians at your side, you will rip through hordes of
    aliens no problem. We're taking any Barrel that increases Stability
    and magazine-extended... Magazines. Extended Magazine would normally
    be a hot mess with a base `Reload` so low, but with Field Prep it
    only takes the reload from ~3.5s to ~4.5s (still 1s shorter than the
    base `Reload`).
