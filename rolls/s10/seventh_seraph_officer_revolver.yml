    *"Timed Payload?! That's supposed to be positively horrible. Doesn't it
    lower your TTK?"* Well, it causes double the flinch and the explosion
    has no range falloff. On a 180 RPM Hand Cannon, Timed Payload
    shouldn't lower the TTK (Drewsky didn't have one on hand to verify the
    math) as you would be getting the kill on the last bullet and not on
    the last 17 damage from Timed Payload.

    Similar to Drewsky's roll, but we're swapping in `Pulse Monitor` instead
    of `Firmly Planted`. I find engagments with 180s to come down to the wire
    and a fresh clip during the gunfight can make all the difference.

    If you'd like a chance at beating down a super, look no further. Well,
    look further because there are better options, but if you want to do it
    with an Officer Revolver, this is a good option.

    The delayed ding from Timed Payload helps stun champions.

    You'll do solid work with in lower/middle tier PvE content (e.g.
    your daily bounty grinds, Vanguard Strike playlist).
