    *"Timed Payload?! That's supposed to be positively horrible. Doesn't it
    lower your TTK?"* Well, it causes double the flinch and the explosion
    has no range falloff. On a 180 RPM Hand Cannon, Timed Payload
    shouldn't lower the TTK (Drewsky didn't have one on hand to verify the
    math) as you would be getting the kill on the last bullet and not on
    the last 17 damage from Timed Payload.

    You'll do solid work with in lower/middle tier PvE content (e.g.
    your daily bounty grinds, Vanguard Strike playlist).
