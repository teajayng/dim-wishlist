    Slideshot paired with either Moving Target or Rangefinder is buffing so
    much of what this Auto Rifle needs help with: Stability and AA. Elemental
    Capacitor?! Yes - it now gets a Recoil and ADS mobility bonus if you use
    Stasis.

    Shredding supers in 6s is, we can all agree, Destiny's National
    Pastime. We're repeating the same set of relaxed rolls above, this
    time pivoting around Vorpal in the final column.

    This is designed for dumping rounds in to enemies in high(er) end PvE
    content. FTTC and Vorpal make the roll; without both you may as well
    use another Vorpal weapon. Based on the past two seasons, they won't
    be hard to come by :)
