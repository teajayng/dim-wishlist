    We're going to use a Counterbalance Mod to get the Recoil to 100, so
    we can go for Stability-enhancing Barrel options. The Handling and
    Stability bonuses from Capacitor are material.

    Same as our initial set of rolls, pivoting around `Vorpal` if you
    love shredding supers in PvP, which we can all agree is Destiny's
    National Pasttime.

    Whenever SMGs are up on the Artifact, you'll want Vorpal to help shred
    through Champions. FTTC might seem like a strange choice for an SMG
    but the rate of fire is so fast, you'd be surprised how often it you
    end up getting it to proc.

    Good for generating Warmind Cells against hordes of enemies. Best for
