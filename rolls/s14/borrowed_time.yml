    General purpose add clear. Pretty standard fare. Try to bump the 
    stability and range, maybe reload speed.

    Super slept on, but a Grave Robber/Demolitionist roll can remove 
    a lot of need to reload simply by using your melee or grenade 
    abilities, which works surprisingly well when there's a lot of 
    close-range adds.

    This has a high zoom, can roll with Rangefinder and a damage perk, 
    so it might do well in PvP.
