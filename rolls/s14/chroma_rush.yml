    With `Heating Up` and `Kill Clip` going, Chroma Rush feels like a
    longer-range
    [Recluse](https://www.light.gg/db/items/3354242550/the-recluse/).
    `Kill Clip` takes you from an optimal TTK of `9h1b/0.77s` to
    `6h2b/0.60s` and your body shot TTK from `1.17s` to `0.83s`. `Heating
    Up` seems practically designed for Auto Rifles, buffing your Accuracy,
    Stability and Recoil 🤯 "But Slif, `Heating Up` will go to waste while
    I'm reloading to proc Kill Clip". The reload is snappy; you'll have
    time. Throw on some some Auto Rifle reload mods if you're concerned.

    This is similar to the above roll, swapping out `Heating Up` in
    exchange for `Tunnel Vision`, which perhaps more synergistically procs
    on reload along with `Kill Clip`.
