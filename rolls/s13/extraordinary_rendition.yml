    Same idea as the above roll, but for crazy people who don't think Surplus is a top-tier perk 😉

    The recent change to `Subsistence` to no longer penalize reserves made it
    an S-tier perk overnight. These three perks in the final column synergize
    super well.

    perks1: [Subsistence]

    This is going to be immensely helpful in **high tier content** where you
    aren't able to proc damage perks off of kills. While `Surplus` will be
    boosting Stability, the Stability is so low and difficult to manage on
    console that we'll continue to crave it as a backstop for when we're at
    lower tiers of `Surplus` benefits.
