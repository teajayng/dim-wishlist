    First we start with a super high default `Blast Radius` of `95`. Then
    we sprinkle on some `Cluster Bomb` action and you've already got a
    great chance of splashing down on packs of Guardians. Add in high
    `Velocity` and improved `Handling` and you've got a snappy air raid
    in your grasp.

    With `Lasting Impression` it's possible to stick a rocket, switch
    to another weapon and debuff the stickee (e.g. Divinity). With Auto-
    Loading Holster, by the time you switch back to Code Duello, it
    should be reloaded. Rinse and repeat! Be forewarned however, this is
    a super niche roll and not at all a run-and-gun RL. It's more for
    grins on what type of "chess" you can play with an RL in Destiny.

    This goes great with Warmind-cell builds for constantly clearing
    adds. Via Rustopholis above, note that Field Prep only checks to see
    if you're crouched at the *start* of the reload animation, not
    throughout.

    This is your standard "stand behind cover / in a well and chuck
    rockets at the boss" roll. Whether or not you value `Frenzy` over
    `Lasting Impression` will depend on the encounter. The barrels and
    masterworks are mostly focused on adding Handling and are gravy
    (but solid if you get them!).
