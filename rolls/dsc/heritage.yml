    Just like the similarly-named roll, with only Snapshot and max Range, you
    still have a terrific roll to take into the Crucible.

    Reconstruction is a new perk that currently only drops on
    rolls from the DSC Raid.  Every 4 seconds it loads 10% of the
    base magazine from reserves into the gun, and it maxes out at
    2x the normal magazine size.  It starts at a base of 6 (12) but
    with Extended Mag and the Backup Mag mod you can get up to 8 (16)
    shots without reloading!

    None of the traditional damage perks (Rampage, Kill Clip, Vorpal) are
    available on this gun, so our best bet for the 4th column is another
    new perk, Recombination.  Final blows from all "elemental" sources
    (so, everything that isn't this shotgun) stack up to 10x.  Each stack
    will add 10% for the next Heritage shot (so up to 2x damage).

    Without Recombination, this is still a top-tier PvE boss DPS roll
