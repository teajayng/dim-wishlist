    Classic "SnapDraw" shotgun roll. Compass Rose can roll with a few Range-
    increasing barrels in addition to just Full Choke and Rifled, so our
    odds of picking up these rolls is a bit better.

    This is for champions or bosses. With Surplus or Field Prep, you'll be able
    to make the most out of Vorpal. Currently with the damage bonus slugs
    received a few seasons back, this is still beat out by FILO, but it's a
    solid alternative if you pick one up.

    Surplus and Wellspring are just so perfectly suited for one another that
    I'm compelled to create rolls that capture them when available. With two
    abilities down, I was able to get both of them back after five or six
    red bar kills. This would be a good workhorse roll, suitable if you
    feel like bringing a shotgun into many of the VoG or DSC encounters.

    If Trench Barrel ever makes a comeback, pairing with Surplus and
    the Reload buff from Trench Barrel should make an interesting
    pairing.
