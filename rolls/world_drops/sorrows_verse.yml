    `One for All` can be a terrific perk for higher tier or under-leveled content where you're not getting a lot of kills quickly (or at all) to provide a solid damage bonus. Both `Surplus` and `Fourth Time's the Charm` have no-kill activation requirements, helping you get more longevity out of `One for All`.
