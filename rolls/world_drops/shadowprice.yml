  overview: >
    With either Arrowhead Brake or Chambered Compensator + Counterbalance,
    you can hit `100` Recoil. Everythign else is this roll is about
    maximzing Stability. The final column doesn't
    have any must-have perks; anything there is gravy. Sure Swashbuckler
    would be nice to have, but it doesn't complete a picture, so I've left
    the final column empty. With at least two abilities active, Surplus is
    going to grant a noticeable improvement to Stability, Handling and
    Reload speed giving this roll a snappy, almost Lightweight-Frame feel.

    Similar to the above roll; swapping in Killing Wind instead of Surplus.

    One for All is a 33% damage boost after tagging three targets. Pair it
    with Overflow you've got a deep mag to burn down while OFA is active.
    If you want this to feel like a laser, Arrowhead Brake is your pick in
    the first column, taking the Recoil from 79 to 100. It also boosts
    Handling by nearly 20%, which you'll notice on ready, stow and aiming.

    Eventually you'll need to reload and once you hit FFx2, you're golden.

    On full-auto weapons, Dragonfly can be tough to proc. 450s are right
    in that sweet spot where at medium-to-longer ranges, getting Dragonfly
    to proc regularly is a real possibility. To help with that, we're
    going to go for better Recoil and Stability with the rest of the roll.
