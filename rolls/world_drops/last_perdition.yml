    Kill Clip brings you down to an optimal 1.6-burst TTK. This is a classic
    pairing that feels terrific to execute.

    With `Moving Target` and `Zen Moment`, your weapon should only produce
    yellow numbers. We'd also be thrilled to get `Firmly Planted` here!

    `Firmly Planted` is criminally underrated. It's a difference in
    playstyle that you have to work at, but you will absolutely be
    rewarded.

    Similar to the set of rolls above, but we're narrowing our scopes
    to create a solid low-zoom pairing with `Rangefinder`.
