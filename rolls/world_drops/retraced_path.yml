    To proc Harmony, you'll need to be swapping over to the Retraced Path after a kill, so run this if you're relying more heavily on your primary weapon.

    If looking to maximize damage with the Retraced Path, this is the roll for you. Tricorn gives you a refreshable 15% damage buff and then a potential 50% (?!) buff after ability-based activation.

    In endgame content, combine a Special Weapon with deep ammo reserves that can expend very little ammo to proc One for All (versus a shotgun, sniper, etc.) to receive a massive 35% damage boost. Pair this with Genesis for **free ammo** when up against Solar-shielded enemies or Shoot to Loot when you need to trace-rifle-snipe from behind cover/across the map. The other perks in column three aren't standouts in endgame PvE. I could imagine this coming in super handy in encounters like Sedia/The Corrupted with those Solar-shielded knights. I'm also voting for the 20% reload speed buff from `Tactical Battery` or `Light Battery` and the Masterwork, over minor bumps to `Stability` or `Range` in those slots.
