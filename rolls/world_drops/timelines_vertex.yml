    If you're able to OHK, terrific! If not, chances are you're at least
    breaking shields and with a quick swap to a primary, you
    have an interesting combo. Typically I would go for more Stability but
    you're getting all of that from Firmly Planted so we can opt for
    Range perks where we can.
