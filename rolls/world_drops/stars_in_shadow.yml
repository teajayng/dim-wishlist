    This set of rolls is all about maxing out Recoil, and keeps
    `Arrowhead Brake` constant as our barrel. You have the option of
    achieving `100` Recoil by slotting in a Counterbalance mod. If not,
    go nuts with your nearly perfectly vertical `94`. `Killing Wind` is
    S-tier and you'd be happy to get any of the final column perks.

    Same as above, using any Stability-boosting barrel, which we'll later

    This set of rolls pivots around `Firmly Planted`. It means that, even
    on console we can opt for `Range`-boosting perks because `Firmly
    Planted` gives us all the `Stability` we need.

    Same as above, using any `Range`-boosting barrel. We'll winnow down
    to drop the barrel requirement as well.

    This set of rolls pivots around `Surplus`. It provides a roughly
    25%, 13% and 8% boost depending on how many abilities are charged.
    You really want to be shooting for
    all three abilities charged at once which means either foregoing their
    use entirely or perhaps investing in high tiers of the respective
    stat (Strength, Discipline, or <class stat>) so that you can quickly
    recharge a single one. The tradeoff is going around with a
    supercharged weapon the whole match.
