    Any time you see Dynamic Sway and Tap the Trigger available in both
    columns, that's a tough one to pass up. TtT keeps you steady on the
    initial burst and DSR keeps you steady afterwards. After that it's
    all `Stability`. This roll would push Stability from 39 to 74 (?!) and
    that's not including the additional Stability from DSR and TtT! With a
    Recoil-fixing Barrel, the mod slot is free for you.

    Similar to the above roll set, except we'll need to use our mod slot
    for `Counterbalance Stock` to fix the `Recoil` (from 90 > 100).
