    The effect to which Combat Grip straights out recoil will surprise you.
    [Have a look!](https://youtu.be/K4nBwU6opJk?t=386) All around Range and
    Stability benefits from the combo of `Smallbore` and `Rangefinder` make
    this a terrific roll.

    Same as the above roll except significanly less `Handling`. "It's a half
    step behind the best roll."

    The catalyst does nothing for Stability, so you want as much as you can get.
    This roll will out-range any 140 RPM Hand Cannon currently in the game.

    Pretty straightforward set of suggestions here. Avoid Moving Target because
    you can get the same bonus from just throwing a Hand Cannon AA mod on your
    helmet.
