    To quote my friend Lenny, "This is the kind of stupid idea I am fond
    of."
    [Aztec's contention](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj1tNWkP9Fg)
    is that slug shotguns struggle because of
    high enemy mobility combined with having to zoom means a much tighter
    field of view that makes them even harder to track. This is precisely
    why I stop using Chaperone around 4000 Glory in Comp. Hunters with
    high mobility (the stat and the skill to do so) and charging shotgun
    rushers become nearly impossible to hit (for me at least!). This is a
    series of rolls based around Hip-Fire Grip and Opening Shot. It's a
    totally different way of playing and I love the idea of it! I doubt
    it will become meta, but this list is all about fun, specific rolls so
    here you go 😃

    `Range`- and `Accuracy`-boosting perks surrounded by Range-boosters
    in all the other columns. `Assault Mag` is also amazing in the second
    column when you're getting so much additional `Range` everywhere else!

    Vorpal + Auto-Loading Holster gives you the greatest uptime in boss DPS phases.
    Add in Assault Mag for slightly higher DPS with the increased rate-of-fire, and
    Full Bore and a Range MW for the most range possible and you've got a stew
    cooking!

    Normally we're pretty strict about locking in third and fourth column perks,
    but "First In" with Vorpal is just so good that getting a great roll sans
    `Auto-Loading Holster` is still worth taking in to a boss damage phase.

    All of the reloading options are interesting in their own way, so we
    have one general set of rolls revolving around `Assault Mag` and
    `Surrounded`.
