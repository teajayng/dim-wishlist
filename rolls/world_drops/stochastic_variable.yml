    With `Feeding Frenzy` and `Multikill Clip` you're turning an already
    terrific weapon into a Recluse-like machine.

    But still great! While `Feeding Frenzy` is the winner in Column 3,
    `Ambitious Assassin` and `Surplus` will also put in work. This is
    the same roll as the above with those just two swapped in, in lieu
    of `Feeding Frenzy`.
