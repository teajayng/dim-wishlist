    Drewsky's roll has me inspired! If double-down on Stability from Surplus, we
    can redirect Barrels and Masterworks to Range.

    With `Feeding Frenzy` and `Multikill Clip` you're turning an already
    terrific weapon into a Recluse-like machine.

    barrels: [Hammer-Forged Rifling]
    magazines: [High-Caliber Rounds]
    perks1: [Feeding Frenzy]
    perks2: [Multikill Clip]

    But still great! While `Feeding Frenzy` is the winner in Column 3,
    `Ambitious Assassin` and `Surplus` will also put in work. This is
    the same roll as the above with those just two swapped in, in lieu
    of `Feeding Frenzy`.
  base_perks: 
    barrels: [Hammer-Forged Rifling]
    magazines: [High-Caliber Rounds]
    perks1: [Surplus, Ambitious Assassin]

    I tend to use `Surplus` and `Wellspring` weapons when accomplishing bounties
    that require ability kills. They're great for high-ability uptime but harder
    to justify compared to the raw damage output of a damage-boosting roll.

    barrels: [Hammer-Forged Rifling]

    perks1: [Surplus]
