    Paired with Stasis or Void, `Elemental Capacitor` is going to do wonders for
    this roll. Your engagements will be juuust around/within the range of
    `Threat Detector`, which buffs Stability and Handling as well.

    Situational super shutdown. It's nearly as satisfying as a Chaperone
    headshot.

    The SI-2 is the only sidearm in the game that can roll with both
    Demolitionist and Dragonfly. That's exciting because Demolitionist
    counts the Dragonfly collateral kills towards getting your grenade
    back. Don't forget the `Dragonfly Spec` mod!

    Sidearms are all the rage in the Season 14 Artifact, and certainly
    will be again at some point in the future. If you want to dump
    rounds in to Champions, you don't have any other options in this
    slot.

    Like Grave Robber and Swashbuckler, these two perks play super well
    off each other.
