  overview: >
    `Firmly Planted` is key to this roll, clearning up all of what ails Fusion Rifles. `Kickstart` active is what allows us to go all-in on damage reduction trade-off for making Charge Time slower. `Arrowhead Brake` allows us to hit `100` Recoil with a `Counterbalance` mod. The benefits from `Firmly Planted` don't make this necessary though, hence the suggestion of most any barrel.

    `High-Impact Reserves` is less of a damage boost than `Kickstart` however, it's still super lethal. If the `Kickstart`-based playstyle isn't for you, give one of these a go. Depending on your ammo situation, `Slideways` might put you out of benefit of `High-Impact Reserves`, so we're documenting a separate roll for it.

    The perks that make this what it is (i.e. change the damage/charge profile of the weapon) are in the fourth column. If you score a complete blank in the third column, there's still hope for a deadly fusion!

    If you score a complete blank on the fourth column perks and bullseye the rest, you've still got a decent PvP Solar Fusion in a pinch.
