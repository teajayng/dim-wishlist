    Frozen Orbit has the lowest handling of any sniper, including Whisper, so
    these rolls counteract that with Quickdraw or Snapshot.

    Toe shots! Aggressive Frame? Kill Clip? Is Tatara Gaze back? Sadly, no.
    Kill Clip rolls in the same slot as Snapshot/Quickdraw, so we need to pick
    some different perks to improve the supremely low handling of this sniper.
    210 or 221 damage to the body with Kill Clip up.

    This one's for the Warlocks. High-Impact Reserves (~+5%) brings damage to
    167 (from 158) on the final two shots of a clip. In an Empowering Rift
    (+20%), this is enough to body (201) a high-resilience guardian. What goes
    well with camping in an empowering rift? No Distractions, Firmly Planted?
    Who cares. This roll is about that tiny +5% damage boost.
