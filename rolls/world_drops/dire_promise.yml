    140s crave Stability. They won't be helped as much by Range as they are by
    what Stability gives you: an AA cone that resets more quickly than it would
    otherwise and less kick to correct for. We're also adding
    `Elemental Capacitor` to the mix, because the bonuses it gives you are
    phenomenal for nearly all elements.
