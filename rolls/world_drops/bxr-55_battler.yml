    "This is the one that I use regularly and I absolutely love it. It's great in both 3s and 6s, and actually kinda decent in PvE. I love this for the all-around, all purpose roll."

    "This should be around 100 Stability, so you don't really need a Stability Masterwork on this. Eye of the Storm will further add on to your Aim Assist cone."

    "Demo gets you grenades and Adrenaline Junkie gets you a minor lethality boost and then a major lethality boost if you land one of those grenades." Neither perk helps with Stability so going with that as the Masterwork.

    Alternatively, Stasis mains might opt for a different Elemental Capacitor roll. This is because Arrowhead gets you to 100 Recoil so the EleCap Recoil buff would be wasted. "Demolitionist for Stasis' long(er) grenade cooldowns. Elemental Capacitor to give you the Recoil you're missing from Arrowhead Brake."
