    Same as the above, replacing `Surplus` with `Dynamic Sway Reduction`.

          Cold Front needs a lot of help in the Stability department, which is
          the entire focus of this roll. At best, you'll be able to get
          Stability up from `16` to `51` plus the benefits coming from Surplus.
          This puts you way above the base Stability on the vaunted Antiope-D and
          other Precision Frame SMGs. The Recoil is `92` so be sure to throw on
          a Counterbalance mod if you don't end up with a +Recoil barrel.

    Same as the above, swapping DSR in for Surplus. These rolls are otherwise
    identical but Surplus is so much better than DSR I wanted to call it out 😀

    While `Surplus` will be boosting Stability, the Stability is so low
    and difficult to manage on console that we'll continue to crave it as
    a backstop for when we're at lower tiers of `Surplus` benefits.

    We'll take any combination of a handful of perks in the final columns
    for a super solid roll (recall that Dragonfly is being replaced by
    Swashbuckler shortly).
