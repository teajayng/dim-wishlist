    Cold Front needs a lot of help in the `Stability` department. A high-`Stability` variant puts you way above the base Stability on the vaunted Antiope-D and other Precision Frame SMGs. The Recoil is `92` so be sure to throw on a Counterbalance mod if you don't end up with a +Recoil barrel. This roll is strict because you need to land a bunch of these in tandem to make it viable. There are three possibilities for the third-column perk, all depending on your play style. The roll is otherwise the same so I'm going to keep them combined and differentiate in the table below.

      |Perk | Stability (Min - Max) |
      |:-|:-:|
      |`Surplus`| 35 - 76 |
      |`Perpetual Motion`| 40 - 61|
      |`Dynamic Sway Reduction`| 44 - 60|

    I've added Harmony here because I believe eventually there will be enough weapons with `Harmony` to where double-`Harmony` loadouts become the norm or at least plenty viable. It's a 20% boost that turns this into a shredder.

    Now that `Subsistence` no longer kills your reserves, it's become an S-tier PvE perk. The fourth-column perks are subjective/context-dependant but the roll is otherwise unchanged due to `Subsistence` so I've combined them all here.
  base_perks:
    barrels: [Chambered Compensator]
    magazines: [Extended Mag]
    perks1: [Subsistence]
    perks2: [One for All, Rampage, Swashbuckler]
    masterworks: [Stability MW]
  extended_perks:
    barrels: [Chambered Compensator, Polygonal Rifling, Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling, Fluted Barrel]

    `Harmony` instantly applies a 20% damage buff that you can start from afar. You have three seconds to swap to Cold Front and then `Harmony` is active for seven seconds. With more weapons getting released with `Harmony`, I think eventually it will be a no-brainer to run double-`Harmony` loadouts. I don't have this flagged for PvP because you're giving up too much Stability by going with `Subsistence` in the third column.
