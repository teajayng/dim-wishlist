    Going for as much `Recoil` and `Stability` improvement as we can get.
    `Kill Clip` is phenomenal on the Gnawing Hunger, bumping your optimal
    TTK from `8c1b/0.80s` to `6c1b/0.60s`.

    Same as the above, expanding acceptable damage bonuses to `Rampage` and
    `Multikill Clip`. They don't provide as much of a damage boost as `Kill
    Clip` does but they're still a nice post-kill boost.

    As much Range as we can get from everywhere we can get it. We're
    combining Subsistence with Swashbuckler or Rampage because those two
    (versus the two kill clips) can be refreshed/extended without
    reloading.

    Remember to slide while reloading after kills for a damage bonus. Bit of a
    playstyle change, but worth experimenting for the benefits.
