    `Firmly Planted` and `Zen Moment` will help with Stability.  If you haven't
    given `Firmly Planted` a shot, it's right at home on Pulse Rifles who have
    long(er) engagement ranges and are more amenable to the crouch. It's a
    difference in playstyle that you have to work at, but you will absolutely be
    rewarded. This perk alone is why the Jian 7 and Last Perdition have become
    two of my most- used pulses.
