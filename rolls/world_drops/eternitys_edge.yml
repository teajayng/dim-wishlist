    With Surrounded and Relentless you'll be slicing for what seems like
    forever. C/o
    [this analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/a2mjez/sword_awareness_1_jagged_edge_vs_honed_edge/),
    Jagged Edge is the clear choice for the first column, but you'll want to
    make sure your reserves are increased in armor. Infinite Guard is locked on
    this weapon, so you're stuck with it :)
