  overview: >
    The IKELOS has `73` Aim Assist and with `Moving Target`, a `Targeting
    Adjuster` mod and `Enhanced Sniper Targeting` on your helm, you're
    plenty good on AA. Whatever tiny part of the `Range` stat affects
    AA is outweighed by faster Handling contributing to faster ADS and
    faster stow speed for cleanups.

    Ehroar and Kackis both review the IKELOS 1.0.2 and land on similar
    reccomendations which I'll capture here. Ehroar's take is a little more
    thorough so I'm expanding the Collector's Edition with his thoughts.

    The core perks are fine, so even though the Baseline is pretty easily
    obtainable, don't let that dissuade you; it's solid!
