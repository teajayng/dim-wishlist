    This core perk combo are both Ekeugan and Ehroar's suggested picks, with EK going so far as to say that `Subsistence` and the retooled `Adrenaline Junkie` are the reasons to run Avalanche. `Appended` is here as the big roll because it lets you keep a larger magazine without sacrificing reload speed, as `Extended Mag` requires. Alternatively if you don't care about reload speed because of Subsistence, then feel free to go with `Extended Mag` so you can use a different weapon mod.

    This is one of the two rolls Ehroar mentions in his video. I'm opting for High-Cal because with Outlaw, magazine size and reload speed don't matter so much. Alternatively I think anything that helps Stability is a solid mag pick here if you're looking to get precision kills. At first I didn't think MGs would be great precision killers but my Commemoration w/Dragonfly has 1,856 kills on it 🤷

    MGs are meant more for add clear where `Vorpal Weapon` isn't going to be a huge help. If MGs ever come up as champion-busting mods in the Seasonal Artifact, a `Vorpal Weapon` roll would be nice to have. I'm opting for `Extended Mag` here to maximize the magazine size without having to use the `Backup Mag` mod. This is because if you're stunning/killing Champions with this you'd want to have the `Major Spec` mod equipped. Alternatively if you're trying to maximize precision shots, there are some Stability-enhancing mags in the extended list as well.
