    Mr. Fun Police himself nabbed an
    [absolutely phenomenal roll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LozV7KaCHs)
    which happens to be this one right here. Just getting a single kill and
    activating `Multikill Clip x 1` takes you from a `6h2b/0.93s` to a
    `6h0b/0.67s` TTK. This place nicely with an ability or two up with
    `Surplus`, to get those crispy reloads.

    Classic combo here. `Surplus` and `Wellspring` were introduced in the
    same season and compliment each other nicely. `Wellspring` takes some
    of the edge off the reluctance to use abilities when running with a
    `Surplus`-based primary.

    PvE tends to be quite ability-heavy so `Surplus` might not be up
    that often but it's gravy when it is, helping you maximize the
    uptime of `One-for-All` and refreshing `Multikill Clip`.
