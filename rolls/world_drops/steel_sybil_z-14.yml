    With Whirlwind and Relentless you'll be slicing for what seems like
          forever. C/o
          [this analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/a2mjez/sword_awareness_1_jagged_edge_vs_honed_edge/),
          Jagged Edge is the clear choice for the first column, but you'll want
          to make sure your reserves are increased in armor. Heavy Guard
          sacrifices Charge Rate and massive increased all the other important
          sword stats, but that's fine because Charge Rate is such a compressed
          stat you won't notice the difference.
