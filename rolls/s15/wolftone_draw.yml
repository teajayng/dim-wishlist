    `Harmony` is perfectly suited for the popular "bow-swap" playstyle in PvP. Start by chunking health down with a bow shot, swap and finish them off. You then have 3s to swap back to the bow and a sweet damage boost. In higher-tier PvE content, you're often getting heavy and special ammo kills which gives a solid primary damage boost follow-up.

    `Adagio` procs off of any kills and if that kill happens to be w/Archer's Tempo, you'll have two higher-damage shots which can provide 100% uptime in PvE.

    `Shoot to Loot` is a terrific perk in higher tier PvE content to help with those famous last words: "I'm making a quick ammo run". While it doesn't pair specifically with Frenzy, the pairing of them make for solid high-tier PvE option.

    In higher-tier content, damage-boosting perks that don't require kills (e.g. One for All, Frenzy) can be super valuable to increase your lethality in an environment where you aren't getting as many kills.
