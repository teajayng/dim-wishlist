    You have to see Cold Denial with 100 `Recoil` and bumped up Stability
    to believe it. It will require that you use a Counterbalance mod,
    which is par for the course on Scattershot weapons (Autos, SMGs,
    etc.). It's completely vertical and barely moves during the burst.
    This roll even without the Stability MW, felt broken when I used it;
    really nuts. It was recently (Spring 2021) learned that Zen Moment's
    perk description is wrong - it affects reticle bounce/shake.

    Similar to the above, but we're swapping in `Killing Wind`, which gives you
    `Opening Shot`-like accuracy and great strafing speed after a kill.

    Proc'ing `Grave Robber` and `Swashbuckler` means you're simultanouesly
    granted ammo while getting a 4.5s, 30% damage boost.
