    Here's a breakdown of what we're going for:


    * `Elastic String`: Sacrifices accuracy to increase draw speed,
      meaning you can pull it back and fire it faster. Aka, lowers ttk
      for the weapon by a small fraction. With this loadout we're not
      too concerned about accuracy as engagements will be at closer
      ranges.

    * `Fiberglass Arrow Shaft`: Lowers stability, which is not
      concerning for a bow, but increases accuracy considerably. This is
      the best type of arrow any bow can have because there are no
      noticeable drawbacks of having it.

    * `Killing Wind`: Adds five tiers of movement speed to your guardian
      when the trait is active, meaning you will feel much quicker and
      lighter, allowing you to play more aggressively.

    * `Unrelenting`: Rewards an aggressive playstyle by granting a small
      amount of health on top of triggering health regeneration. In the
      Crucible, every other guardian kill will trigger this trait.
      Triggering this trait means you'll have less downtime between
      engagements, and you'll have some room to perform interesting
      plays in 1v2/3 or more scenarios.

    * `Accuracy Masterwork`: This helps conteract the reduction in
      accuracy that Elastic string has, making the bow feel a little
      more reliable when shooting.

    The objective of this loadout is to max it's Accuracy as high as it
    can go, so that the player can use it at longer distances and not feel
    forced to engage at closer ranges.


    * `High Tension String`: We're going for max accuracy with this
      loadout.
    * `Fiberglass Arrow Shaft`: Again, the best Arrow type for any bow.
    * `Archer's Tempo`: High Tension String gives an increase to draw
      speed, and Archer's Tempo will act to negate its effects while
      still lowering Draw Time to a reasonable degree.
    * `Opening Shot`: Further increases Accuracy and bullet magnetism to
      the head, making the bow more reliable at longer distances.
    * `Accuracy Masterwork`: Again, going for as high of an Accuracy
      stat as we can.
