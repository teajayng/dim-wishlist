    Vorpal is a solid tool to have here. This roll won't do the most single-
    target damage against bosses, but that's not why you have it; you have it
    for the utility it brings. Being able to slice through adds **and** throw
    a heavy attack at a Champion or Boss at basically unlimited range, is
    a great tool in the kit (think Shriekers!).

    `Whirlwhind` greatly increases damage for `3s`. You can generate the buff
    then throw the projectile.

    Standard set of sword perks here. "Free" damage boost gained just from
    risky(ier) CQC positioning which you likely already have by virtue of the
    fact you're using a sword 🙃
