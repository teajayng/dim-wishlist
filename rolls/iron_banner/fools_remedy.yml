    Both `Iron Gaze` and `Iron Grip` would be amazing paired with a big
    `Stability` increase alongside better accuracy from `Moving Target`.

    Similar to the above, whereas it was about getting the kill, this
    is about chaining kills. `Kill Clip` turns this into an absolute
    monster with a `0.53s` optimal TTK and an insane `0.80s` body-shot
    TTK.
