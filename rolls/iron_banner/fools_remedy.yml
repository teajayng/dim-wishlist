  overview: >
    Working backwards from `Iron Gaze` (+20 AA), we're going for as much
    `Stability` as we can. We'd end choosing the rest of the roll
    similarly if we landed `Kill Clip` or `Eye of the Storm` in the final
    slot, so we'll combine these rolls.

    Working backwards from `Iron Grip` (+20 Stability), we can free up
    some of our other columns for non-Stability enhancing perks.

    This is a weird one... we're draining the mag to get the reload
    boost from `Alloy Magazine` so we have to watch out for other
    perks that might short-circuit this way of using it.
