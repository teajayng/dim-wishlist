    Moving Target and Iron Gaze are going to bump Target Acquisition
    immensely. You give up a few meters of damage falloff, and in return
    significantly increased accuracy.

    This is primarily a roll for sixes where TSH can shine as a cleanup
    weapon with a higher chance of chaining kills. Keep in mind that a
    `Resilience` of `5` cancels out the Swashbuckler two-tap from full
    health but in sixes that's not always what you're dealing with. If you
    can pair this with a ranged melee (Swashbuckler x 5) you'llI
    wouldn't suggest this roll for Comp or Trials.

    If you pair a Quickdraw TSH with a breach-load GL with a Quick Access
    Sling mod, you have a super powerful combination. Pairing it with Le
    Monarque has a similar effect: massive damage with an opening shot from
    your Energy weapon and a single shot from TSH to clean up. With
    Quickdraw and Snapshot, this Aggressive Frame can feel like a
    Lightweight.

    Many phenomenal perks in column three and column four. As Fallout
    mentions in his review, you'd be kinda happy to get any of them.

    Without Outlaw, you're going to have to rely on Transversives,
    Marksman's Dodge, etc. to reload effectively in PvE. Without it,
    you're looking at a lot of downtime in situations where there are
    better alternatives. This is the case with Outlaw-based Duke rolls
    and people absolutely loved that sooo ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
