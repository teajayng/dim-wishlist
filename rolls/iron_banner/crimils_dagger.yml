    One of the rare weapons that can roll with both `Moving Target` and
    `Opening Shot` at the same time. The 110s have a punishing kick so
    after that, we're going for `Stability`.

    The 110s have low Handling because they're supposed to embody the
    "Cannon" part of "Hand Cannon". Adding Snapshot to the mix can make
    all the difference in how a 110 feels.

    Replacing our need for `Outlaw` with `Drop Mag`, then as much `Range`
    as we can get.
