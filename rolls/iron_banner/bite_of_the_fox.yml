  overview: >
    This series of rolls is based around Snapshot and Accuracy-increasing
    final-column perks. After that, we're looking for as much `Range` and
    `Handling` as we can get.

    barrels: [Fluted Barrel]
    magazines: [Accurized Rounds]
    perks1: [Snapshot]
    perks2: [Opening Shot]

    Same as the above set of rolls, but with `Moving Target` instead of
    `Opening Shot`.

    As suggested by Drewsky in his
    [Bite of the Fox Has a Unique "God Roll" to Farm For](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLfGLa-oYg)
    video, here's a similar set of rolls based on `Firmly Planted`.
  base_perks:
    barrels: [Fluted Barrel]
    magazines: [Accurized Rounds]
    perks1: [Firmly Planted]
    perks2: [Opening Shot]

    Similar to the above set of `Firmly Planted`-based rolls, but this
    time with `Moving Target` in the final slot. Oddly, you get the
    `Accuracy` benefit of `Moving Target` without actually moving.
