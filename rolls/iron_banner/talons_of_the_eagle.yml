    `Firmly Planted` is terrific on long-range weapons like Pulse and
    Scout Rifles where you can post up in cover and peek shoot from a
    distance. There's also not much else terrific in that slot. Zen
    Moment is good, but Firmly Planted outclasses it.

    We're going to repeat the same set of rolls that we have above, minus
    `Firmly Planted` which is a pretty big playstyle preference that some
    folks are not super keen on. It's not a make-or-break here, so we're
    also going to feature rolls without it.

    `Outlaw` + `Rampage`, same as it ever was! Going for the classic DPS
    combo with as much `Range` as we can get.
