    `Tap the Trigger` starts you off stable and `Dynamic Sway Reduction`
    keeps you stable. `Iron Grip` is a crazy boost to `Stability`.

    Don't underestimate the effect of MKC. Here's how it plays out:

    * Base: 9 shots (8C, 1B) - 0.8s TTK // 14B 1.3s

    * MKCx1: 7 shots (7C, 0B) - 0.6s TTK // 12B 1.1s


    That's a pretty solid little boost; definitely spicy in sixes.

    Since damage falloff happens at 20m, you want these super zoomed out
    scopes and all the `Stability` and `Handling` we can get. We're only
    going to accept low-zoom scopes because you can only use this as close
    range and long-zoom scope won't have any use (and works against you).

    Classic combo here. Grave Robber creates ammo to reload the mag and
    that melee kill will activate Swashbuckler x5.

    While Feeding Frenzy was slightly nerfed, it's still a terrific perk,
    activating (and stackin) on any kill. With two kills, you're at Outlaw
    level and with three kills you're beyond Outlaw.
