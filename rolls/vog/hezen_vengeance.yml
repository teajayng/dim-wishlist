    The reload benefit from `Impulse Amplifier` is what we're after here, to get as many rockets off onto big targets as quickly as possible.

    `Auto-Loading Holster` works well with boss DPS in rhythm with a special weapon. E.g. snipe-snipe-snipe-rocket-snipe-snipe-snipe-rocket.

    It pairs well with any large-target-related dps perk in the third column. Demolitionist does have a cooldown, but an extra RL from a "free" reload is effectively a damage boost of another kind. This is more of a specialized but with so many ways to keep a grenade ready to go, worth investing in.
