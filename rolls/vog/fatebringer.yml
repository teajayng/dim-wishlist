    [`Killing Wind` is phenomenal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bLA3wkBBE&t=320s). `Killing Wind` (procs on kill) lasts six seconds and `Kill Clip` lasts five seconds (procs on reload). The base reload on Fatebringer is 2.81s (thank you d2gunsmith.com) meaning you'll have the combined benefit for a minimum of 3.2s. The more you buff your reload, the longer the benefit. No, `Rewind Rounds` does not proc `Kill Clip` 🙂

    `Rewind Rounds` returns approximately 40% of the hits you made with it to the magazine recursively. So a Fatebringer with 10 in the magazine will go 10 -> 4 -> 1 = 15 rounds before needing to reload. Fatebringer is a 140 RPM, which equates to 2.3 bullets per second. `Kill Clip` lasts six seconds which would be or 13.8 (14) bullets. With `Rewind Rounds` you can make maximum use of `Kill Clip` without reloading. This of course, assumes you're hitting every shot 😬😬😬

    In GMs, even minor enemies are bullet sponges. `Frenzy` has always been a solid perk (like `One for All`) to get you a damage bump without having to get kills.

    [Explosions!?!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D13ebYdvNf0) `Explosive Payload` is the rare 3rd column damage perk! Great for damaging enemies at a distance and proc'ing Overload Champion stunning (when hand cannons are in season) one shot earlier.
