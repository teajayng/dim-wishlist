    High-Impact kicks in halfway down the mag, which `Rewind Rounds` extends. While Machine Guns aren't necessarily meant for boss or champion DPS, this pairing can make it far more effective.

    Since it takes only a couple of shots to kill most enemies, `Subsistence` means you almost never have to reload. Since you'll be switching targets quickly, `One for All` means an extended damage boost pared with an infinite mag.

    Throw a grenade, which procs `Demolitionist` and you reload your weapon. The grenade kills enemies which procs `Adrenaline Junkie` allowing you to kill enemies faster to get your grenade back faster via `Demolitionist`. Rinse and repeat.
