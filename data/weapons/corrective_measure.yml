overview: >
  The Corrective Measure is a 450 RPM Adaptive Frame Machine Gun that drops in the Vault of Glass (Confluxes, Templar and Atheon).

  > That is the reason why Corrective Measure is one of my favorite Machine Guns of all time, because it bridges the gap of two of the best builds I like to use. ... The Corrective Measure is the perfect Machine Gun and I don't think it will ever be surpassed - [Ehroar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navEfNqoV_E)

  Adaptive Frame MGs are solid in PvP because they mix a good amount of flinch with a good amount of damage. Corrective Measure is particulary good one because its `Recoil` is a vertical `85` with a high base `Stability`. With the right perks you can effectively max out `Stability.
  
  In PvP, you're picking up a small heavy ammo mag and so you want to choose perk combinations that will [make it count](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qy6Kh5dkTeo&t=376s). That context (for better or worse) rules out most perks so we'll have a short list of rolls ðŸ™‚

  From [Ehroar's review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navEfNqoV_E), there's a lot to like about Corrective Measure.


  1. "It's a 450 RPM, which is the sweet spot for PvE and PvP."

  1. It has Demolitionist in the left perk slot (which is rare), meaning you can still take advantage of other great fourth column perks.

  1. It's Void, so it works with Nezarac's Sin ðŸ˜ˆ

  1. It can roll with `Firefly` which can create Warmind Cells when paired with the `Wrath of Rasputin` armor mod.


  Plenty of fun rolls featured. Enjoy!
