overview: >
  For a moment in time, Swarm of the Raven was a legit DPS option. It's a
  Void Grenade Launcher and the buff from Tractor Cannon made it a beast.
  It's not super hot anymore, but why not secure yourself a good one just
  in case? Chances are without even trying you're going to get a pretty
  decent roll. Enjoy!
