overview: >
  Talons of the Eagle is a 150 RPM "High-Impact Frame" Kinetic Scout Rifle.
  It originally appeared wayyy back in Season 4 (aka Forsaken). It's been
  recently re-issued in the first Season 11 Iron Banner. As part of this
  re-issue, the perk pool is unchanged, so we have years' worth of knowledge
  about how these work and years' worth of confusion as to why Scout Rifles
  can roll with `Threat Detector` and `Hip-Fire Grip`.

  In order to beat out other long-range options in the Kinetic slot for PvP,
  I think you really want `Explosive Payload` here. 150s are the
  slowest-firing, heaviest-hitting scouts but when you're competing against
  snipers and Arbalests, I think you need more flinch than they can put out
  at base. The drawbacks of 150s are their low `Stability` and `Handling` so
  we're going to address those as a secondary focus in all in all of our
  rolls.

  Talons is still rocking an ancient perk pool, so not a lot of compelling
  rolls here for PvE.
