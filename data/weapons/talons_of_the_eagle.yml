overview: >
  Talons of the Eagle is a 150 RPM "High-Impact Frame" Kinetic Scout Rifle.
  It originally appeared wayyy back in Season 4 (aka Forsaken). It's been
  recently re-issued in the first Season 11 Iron Banner. As part of this
  re-issue, the perk pool is unchanged, so we have years' worth of knowledge
  about how these work and years' worth of confusion as to why Scout Rifles
  can roll with `Threat Detector` and `Hip-Fire Grip`.
