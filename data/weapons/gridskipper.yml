  Gridskipper is a phenomenal PvP weapon and arguably the best weapon
  introduced in S14. Many folks have reviewed it; here are a handful of
  selections:

  
  * [Ascendant Nomad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya5a-uIbq7w) - *"The feel of
  this gun is so very Destiny... and so terribly well-balanced and is yet
  another reminder that Bungie is the best at fun gameplay, bar none.*
  
  * [ZkMushroom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M8xjUzDRfU) - *"This is the best
  pulse rifle in the game. Better than Messenger, 100%. Time to do the new
  activity to get the god roll!*"

  * [DFP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Y5XZrTjSxs) - *"This thing is an
  absolute laser beam. Terrific Aim Assist and a vertical recoil pattern. It
  ticks all the boxes for me."*


  `Frenzy`, while great in PvE, has steep activation requirements in PvP and has
  an immaterial impact on your TTK. Let's go with `Multikill Clip` instead: At
  x1, MKC drops your TTK from `7c2b/0.80s` to `7c0b/0.67s` and your body shot
  TTK from `1.40s` to a much more palatable `1.13s`.
