overview: >
  With season 15's changes to High-Impact Frame pulse rifles, you now have to charge for a full second to shoot five bolts, four of which still have to land in PVP to turn another player into pretty sparkles. [This PVP roll](https://twitter.com/Mercules904/status/1433789357069160453) aims to bring that down to three bolts.
