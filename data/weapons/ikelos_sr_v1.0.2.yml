overview: >
  The IKELOS_SR_V1.0.2 is a 140 RPM Rapid-Fire Frame sniper. Stat-wise, the
  currently available batch are
  [mostly the same](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=BKsJdr;o8g0X;DN5NWh;BLxysY)
  and unfortunately none can roll with both `Snapshot` and `Quickdraw` ðŸ˜±
  Note that the IKELOS does have a slightly higher Zoom (40 > 45) than half
  of the bunch. This may or may not work with your playstyle.

  "What roll will replace my Beloved?"
  Unfortunately none of them. No 140 RPM sniper beyond the S11 power cap
  can roll like Beloved, Tatara Gaze, Apostate, etc. It looks like they're
  almost purposefully decoupling the great perks we're used to seeing
  together: Snapshot + Quickdraw, Snapshot + Opening Shot, etc.


  Some thoughts on the perks I've selected:
        
        
  * I value `Moving Target` over `No Distractions` for a few reasons.
  Contrary to the name, `Moving Target` procs
  [whether or not you're moving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcpJWC039m8).
  `No Distractions` takes 1.5-2s to activate. That is an eternity and
  basically unusable in Comp or Trials. Even when it does activate, `No
  Distractions` doesn't reduce flinch by that much. Here, check out
  [Fallout's testing](https://youtu.be/cUE4W03qPVY?t=171).

  * `Seraph Rounds`, has just about every hidden benefit you can imagine
  ascribed to it. The only one I'm able to find definitive evidence for
  is that it increases range falloff by about 2m. When I compared it with
  `Accurized Rounds` on the IKELOS SMG, it pushed it about 1m further.
  That's the only reason I prefer it here, but they're basically the same
  in that one aspect. IMHO Bungie could definitely stand to redefine this
  perk if they're planning on keeping IKELOS weapons around.


  There aren't a ton of great perks here, so I'm only featuring one roll
  with two variations: favouring `Handling` and favouring `Range`.

  Ehroar and Kackis both review the IKELOS 1.0.2 and land on similar
  reccomendations which I'll capture here. Ehroar's take is a little more
  thorough so I'm expanding the Collector's Edition with his thoughts.

  The core perks are fine, so even though the Baseline is pretty easily
  obtainable, don't let that dissuade you; it's solid!
