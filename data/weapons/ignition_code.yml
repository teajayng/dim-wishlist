  Highlights from the streamerati:


  * [Ehroar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk53lvImHRU) *"The most important
  weapon to get this season that will be relevant in the PvE meta for some
  time"*

  * [Frostbolt](https://youtu.be/jJFV_4Y6p7s) *"This thing is horrifying. It's
  going to remind you of The Mountaintop It's like a full-auto GL!"*


  Well, I'm not sure the world of players will get as much utility out of this
  in PvP as Frostbolt does, but you will definitely make magic with it inside of
  PvE. If there's one Splicer weapon you farm for this season, make it the
  Ignition Code.

  There seems to be a new PvP meta emerging / has emerged using GLs to
  "prime" (i.e. do a material amount of damage to you) and then finish you
  off with a high-impact/low-RoF primary. It's been the case for a couple
  of seasons by now, but I'm seeing it more now that Ignition Code is so
  easy to get.

  Ignition Code is the only obtaininable Kinetic GL in the game that can
  roll with `Blinding Grenades` which, if you're planning on doing anything
  remotely resembling challenging PvE content, is a must-have.
  Ehroar put together a
  [solid review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk53lvImHRU)
  of Ignotion Code in PvE.
