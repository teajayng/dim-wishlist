overview: >
  Fractethyst is a Precision Frame (65 RPM) Stasis Shotgun, introduced in Season 15. The [best roundup I've seen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCbDZy-hqoI) is courtesy of Castle Content, and much of what you'll see here is recapped from his review.

  Finally a replacement for the fallen king of Destiny Shotguns [Dust Rock Blues](https://d2gunsmith.com/w/636912560)! Fractethyst will round out your Kinetic slot shotgun suite and will do it in style, with some super interesting new perks. With the latest round of nerfs to shotguns, Lightweight and Precision Frame models are where it's at (excluding exotics of course).

  Shotguns had their moment in the sun back around Forsaken with pre-nerf Trench Barrel. These days, bosses (and majors) tend to have knockback and shotguns don't see much use in higher-level PvE content due to the risk of CQC in GMs, Master-VoG, etc.
