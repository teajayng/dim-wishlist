  A few highlights from [Ehroar's review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjXicVb4zTM) combined with highlights from [Rustopholis' video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXnNIV7y05M) on Rocket Launcher perks in general.

  ### Column Three Perks

  * 游댮 `Surplus` Reload benefit is outclassed by `Impluse Amplifer`.

  * 游리 `Tracking Module` is good for situations where you want to use a Rocket Launcher and the Champion/Boss is moving around a lot.

  * 游리 `Impulse Amplifier` would be used more for the Reload speed buff than Velocity.

  * 游릭 `Overflow` is far and away the best perk in this column, allowing **sustained** DPS far beyond any other Rocket Launcher in the game.


  ### Column Four Perks

  * 游댮 `Cluster Bombs`, after two successive nerfs, now looks to provide a ~6% damage boost if all the clusters hit the target. This perk was the absolute meta in Year 1 of Destiny 2 and that is no longer the case.

  * 游댮/游릭 `Lasting Impression` provides a ~19% damage boost. "Works great with add clear too and can be good for Champions to burst them down quickly." This one is going to have multiple perspectives. Rustopholis [feels the opposite](https://youtu.be/RXnNIV7y05M?t=420) on the usefulness of `Lasting Impression` in spite of its damage boost.

  * 游리 `Demolitionist` was changed so that the reload part of the perk has a cooldown, so you can't chain reload a Rocket Launcher by throwing grenades. It works for sure, but isn't going to boost your DPS as much as the other options.

  * 游릭 `Vorpal` continues to provide a flat 15% damage boost with no activation requirements. Well, it needs to be a Champion or Boss 游뗶


  ### What, no Impact Casing?!

  > *"Impact Casing is a 2.22% damage boost. You are still misinformed."* - [Rustopholis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXnNIV7y05M&t=151s)


  *"OK but Slif, 2.22% is a better damage boost than nothing. And nothing else in the Magazine column boosts damage."*


  The faster you can reload your Rocket Launcher, the more damage you can do, and there are a handful of `Reload`-boosting perks in that column that are (always?) better choices.
