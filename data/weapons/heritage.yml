overview: >
  Heritage is a kinetic "precision frame" (slug) shotgun that can drop from the
  2nd and 3rd encounters of the Deep Stone Crypt raid.  After the initial drop,
  you have a chance of getting additional rolls from the raid's secret chests.
pvp_comments: >
  Heritage has the highest aim assist of any slug shotgun.

  says "this weapon is really comparable to The Chaperone."

  
  The base one hit kill range is 10.5m, you can increase that up to 11.9m with
  Killing Wind and Slideshot active.
pve_comments: >
  Slug shotguns currently enable some of the highest DPS in the game, and are
  the meta-loadout for boss DPS in a number of encounters, including the
  final boss of the raid.
