overview: >
  Heritage is a kinetic "precision frame" (slug) shotgun that can drop from the 2nd
  and 3rd encounters of the Deep Stone Crypt raid.  After the initial drop,
  you have a chance of getting additional rolls from the raid's secret chests.

  As of Season 12, it is the only legendary kinetic slug shotgun that is
  viable in leveled content.
