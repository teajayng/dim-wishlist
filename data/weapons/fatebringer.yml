overview: >
  Fatebringer is a 140 RPM hand cannon, back in a reprised version from the
  Vault of Glass.  In D2, it's a kinetic (in D1 it was Arc).  It drops in the
  Vault of Glass from Templar or Gatekeeper encounters. Once acquired, it will
  also drop from either of the two secret chests and can be acquired from the
  post-Atheon chest for `Spoils of Conquest` x 20.

  We're going with recommendations on this heavily influenced by
  [Fallout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bLA3wkBBE).

  The "Timelost" (or "Adept") version of this weapon drops only by completing
  the Templar encounter Challenge in Master mode. That weapon has a different
  serial number in Destiny's database and is registered in this wishlist
  separately.

  After the 120 RPM hand cannon nerf, 140 RPM hand cannons are top-tier in the
  crucible in season 15.

  Fatebringer has a very crisp feel to it, reminiscent of it's D1 incarnation.
  There are a number of solid perks available on it and it is viable in both
  regular and end-game content, including GMs in seasons where hand cannons
  have champion mods.
