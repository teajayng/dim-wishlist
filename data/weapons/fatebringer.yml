overview: >
  Fatebringer is a 140 RPM hand cannon, back in a reprised version from Destiny 1 via the Vault of Glass.  It drops from either the Templar or Gatekeeper encounters.  Once acquired, it will also drop from either of the two secret chests and can be acquired from the post-Atheon chest for `Spoils of Conquest` x 20.


  We're going with recommendations on this heavily influenced by [Fallout's review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bLA3wkBBE).

  After the 120 RPM Hand Cannon nerf, 140 RPM hand cannons are top-tier in the Crucible in Season 15. Fatebringer has a terrific set of base stats, arguably the best Kinetic Hand Cannon alongside Eyasluna.

  Fatebringer has a very crisp feel to it, reminiscent of it's D1 incarnation. There are a number of solid perks available on it and it is viable in both regular and end-game content, especially GMs when Hand Cannons have Champion mods.
