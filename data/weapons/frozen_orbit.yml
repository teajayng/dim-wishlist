  Frozen Orbit is an Energy-slot, Aggressive Frame Sniper. It's been in the
  Crucible loot pool since Season #####. It is most comparable to a Tatara
  Gaze (sunset).

  Aggressive Frame snipers are the only ones that can one-shot every super
  in the Crucible. Every super has a different damage-resistance tier that
  affects your ability to do that however Aggressive Frames do not care
  about such things.

  Outlaw, Clown Cartridge, and Triple Tap all pair nicely with Wellspring,
  High-Impact Reserves, and Vorpal for PvE.
