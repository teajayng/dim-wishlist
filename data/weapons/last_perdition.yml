overview: >
  A randomly-rolled 390RPM Adaptive Pulse Rifle; here we go! If you like
  Bygones in the primary slot, Last Perdition is right up your alley. It
  was brought back in Season of the Drifter with random rolls, and it
  unfortunately kept a pretty baseline set of perks. There's so much magic
  happening in the Energy slot now that we're so deep into Destiny 2 that
  we're going to have a pretty high bar for rolls here.
