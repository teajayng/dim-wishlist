overview: >
  A randomly-rolled 390RPM Adaptive Pulse Rifle; here we go! If you like
  Bygones in the primary slot, Last Perdition is right up your alley. It
  was brought back in Season of the Drifter with random rolls, and it
  unfortunately kept a pretty baseline set of perks. That being said, it's
  still an absolutely terrific Pulse Rifle!

  Lots of resources for this one, including the
  [Destiny Massive Breakdowns](https://www.destinymassivebreakdowns.com/)
  [podcast](https://soundcloud.com/destinymassivebreakdowns).
  I'll be quoting (or paraphrasing if I couldn't keep up :) Kyt_Kucha and
  Mercules904 quite a bit in here.


  * Kyt: "Stability helps your Aim Assist cone recover more quickly. Recoil
  makes the bursts more linear but it's not the same thing as having more
  Stability."

  * Kyt: "Wouldn't go with a zoom factor of less than 3 because otherwise you
  feel recoil too much"

  * M904: "Accurized Rounds for +10 range, but maybe not if you picked a
  medium to high zoom scope (go for more Stability)"

  * M904: "Remember that Range has a linear effect and Zoom has a
  multiplicative effect. Rangefinder is 0.1x zoom - be careful of it because
  it may push you too far. Using it with +2x SPO-26 would be a good combo.
  If you don't roll Rangefinder but you do roll a higher zoom scope, you can
  ignore Rangefinder. If you only have short-zoom scopes, use Rangefinder."

  * CoolGuy's review: [Last Perdition 2.0 In Depth Review - Top Tier
  Pulse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6nVNWTEttc) is terrific. Long zoom
  scopes aren't recommended because of the increased incoming flinch while
  ADS and they also decrease Handling which can make the weapon feel more
  sluggish. `Zen Moment` is capped out at 66% of Base Stability, which is
  super high at 66, so we're going to prioritize that.


  For some general slaying footage, ZkMushroom loves his Last Perdition!
  Here he is on PC -
  ["My Favorite Pulse Rifle"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jXTmYiHbWQ) -
  and earlier on console - ["Last Perdition is the Best Pulse Rifle in the 
  Game?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwucqcnyX-s). "I don't like laning
  with pulses. I know Blast Furnace and Bygones will be better there. I like
  being aggressive with my pulse and this is the perfect one."

  When Last Perdition was brought back with random rolls in the Season of
  the Drifter, it came back with the standard perk pool from Destiny 2 Year
  1. We're looking for classic pairings here.
