overview: >
  The Steady Hand (TSH) is a 120 RPM "Aggressive Frame" Kinetic Hand Cannon,
  re-issued in Year 4 with random rolls. Prior to Season 12 in November 2020,
  Aggressive Frames were bumped from 110 RPM to 120 RPM as part of a
  [large scale Hand Cannon rework](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/49676).
  The general consensus thus far is that TSH is terrific.

  What I love about these videos (and this set of perks) is that there is not
  absolute agreement on which roll is the best.

  Iron Banner weapons tend to shine in PvP, so we won't feature many PvE
  builds.


  Generally in PvE you're going for as much `Range` as you can get with
  sustained damage upkeep. If you liked
  [The Duke Mk. 44](https://www.light.gg/db/items/2112909414/duke-mk-44/)
  then TSH could be for you.
