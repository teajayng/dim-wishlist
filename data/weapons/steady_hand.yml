overview: >
  The Steady Hand (TSH) is a 120 RPM "Aggressive Frame" Kinetic Hand Cannon,
  re-issued in Year 4 with random rolls. Prior to Season 12 in November 2020,
  Aggressive Frames were bumped from 110 RPM to 120 RPM as part of a
  [large scale Hand Cannon rework](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/49676).
  The general consensus thus far is that TSH is terrific.
