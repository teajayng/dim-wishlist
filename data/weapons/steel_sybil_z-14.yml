  "But Slif, Falling Guillotine is void and is way better DPS. Why would I
  keep a Steel Sybil around?" Great question, let's turn it over to Joe:

  But given the small sword perk pool, it's never really been hard to
  scrounge up a serviceable weapon at the time you need it. I'd imagine
  guillotine will become better for wide damage, sybil better for single
  target. But as of today, you only need guillotine.
