overview: >
  The Steel Sybil is a re-issue of the Crucible sword from the launch of
  Forsaken back in Season 4.


  With the advent of Caster and Vortex Frame swords, Adaptives like the
  Steel Sybil have fallen out of favour since they're individually better at
  whatever you would choose to do with a Steel Sybil. Sybils drop regularly
  though and have a small perk pool, so we'll throw something together
  because a great roll is a great roll.
