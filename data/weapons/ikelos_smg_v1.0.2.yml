overview: >
  The IKELOS SMG 1.0.2 is an Aggressive Frame, Energy-slot 750 RPM SMG. With
  the advent of Warmind Cell mods, it has become a PvE staple.
pvp_comments: >
  Back during the
  Warmind times (Season 3) its statically-rolled predecessor was a
  seriously legit part of the PvP meta. Apart from the original IKELOS SMG,
  in the history of Destiny 2, this archetype has had an unfortunate time
  of things. The only
  [other Aggressive Frames](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=CEeZUk;BZzrdV;GStUF;)
  have punishingly, unusably poor `Stability` so they never saw any
  play, not even on the fringes of the meta.


  A few weeks into Season 11 an Bungie drops the new version of the IKELOS
  SMG, now called the IKELOS_SMG_V1.0.2 (compared to S3's V1.0.1). It now
  features random rolls with the new Y3 perks like Vorpal Weapon and
  Demolitionist. It also has a tremendous amount of Stability compared to
  its brethren, about triple.


  * **`Seraph Rounds`**: The streamer~youtuberati are all abuzz about this
  perk. It has HCR built-in and does increased flinch! It increases
  Stability! It increases Range! One of those
  is correct - it does give a boost to damage falloff range. When I
  tested `Seraph Rounds` in the Tribute Hall, it pushed the range out by
  ~1m. Yep, a whole one meter. When I swapped in Accurized Rounds, it was
  basically the same, with a difference of less than a meter. I wouldn't 
  lose sleep about missing out on `Seraph Rounds`. Since this is a console
  wishlist and these Aggressive Frame SMGs have huge kick, we're going to
  prefer `Steady Rounds` and the attendant 38% increase in `Stability`.
        
  * **`Threat Detector`**: The only evidence I've been able to find of how
  this perk works is present in this video:
  ["Threat Detector In Depth"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EB7Fgvgchq8)
  which deduces a massive +20 to Stability at TDx1. The range for TDx1 is
  14.8M (and below of course) which means a laser-like boost to Stability
  to where you could practically hip-fire the darn thing (no it does not
  drop with Hip-Fire Grip in its perk pool :)

        
  Which set of rolls you go for depends on whether or not you want to keep
  your mod slot open for `Icarus Grip` or `Freehand Grip`. If you don't
  care for either of those, that's going to free up your choice of Barrels
  and you'll be able to throw a `Counterbalance Stock` mod in to fix the
  recoil.

  Ehroar thinks the IKELOS_SMG_V1.0.2 might be the
  [best PvE primary in Destiny 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sgVvsCK2BM)
  mostly because it can generate Warmind Cells and it has a great perk
  pool. He makes a strong case and with Reach, the nukes are nukey.
        
        
  Note that the IKELOS_SMG also has `Disruption Break` will will proc when
  breaking a Barrier Champion's shield. However no other perks play off of
  it, so I won't feature a set of rolls here for it. Same goes for
  `Demolitionist` which is a great perk but doesn't overtly synergize with
  any of the other perks. As Ehroar points out, `Subsistence` wrecks the
  reserves on the IKELOS, by a whopping 44% (!) so I'm not recommending it
  as a perk.
