overview: >
  Zephyr is a re-issued Adaptive Frame Sword which (as of December 2021 drops) does Stasis damage. It features the new `Cold Steel` perk which applies "Slow" stacks, eventually building up and freezing targets. Ehroar covers the nuts and bolts of the new perks and reccomended rolls across two videos:

  * [Zephyr is LITERALLY a Stasis Sword](https://youtu.be/qJGJdiEJuxc) - Ehroar


  All of these rolls feature Jagged Edge:

  > *Jagged Edge is roughly ~5% more damage than Honed Edge. If you wear few pieces of "sword reserve" gear you can still cap your reserves.* -- [/u/StatusZe](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/a2mjez/sword_awareness_1_jagged_edge_vs_honed_edge/)

  **A note on odds**: In the 2021 December Dawning event, there are buffs that allow Dawning weapons to (possibly) roll with double perks in each of the final columns. Since it's not gauranteed, we're going to leave the odds as of only one perk existed in each column.
