overview: >
  The Interference VI (IVI) is a 120RPM Adaptive Frame, Arc Grenade Launcher.
  It was reissued in Season 10. The perk pool is really small, with only four
  possibilities in the final two columns, which slightly offsets the number of
  perks in the first and second columns.

  
  You might want to keep one because it's one of the rare Grenade Launchers
  that can roll
  [Full Court]().
  Full Court, at max range(> 50m) has a 25% damage increase. The only other GLs
  that can roll Full Court are `Doomsday` (no longer available) and `Love and
  Death` from Luna.
  
  
  It's worth picking up!
