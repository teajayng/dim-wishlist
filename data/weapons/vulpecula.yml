overview: >
  Vulpecula is a 180 RPM Kinetic Stasis Hand Cannon, introduced in Season of the Lost (S15). If you're confused and barely able to pronounce the names of the Season 15 weapons, so am I! Fortunately, the Sliflist is here to help. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulpecula):

  > *Vulpecula /vÊŒlËˆpÉ›kjÊŠlÉ™/ is a faint constellation in the northern sky. Its name is Latin for "little fox", although it is commonly known simply as the fox. It was identified in the seventeenth century, and is located in the middle of the Summer Triangle (an asterism consisting of the bright stars Deneb, Vega, and Altair).*

  In general, 180s are high in ease of use with great base stats (recoil, stability, aim assist) and low in lethality (range and impact). This is typical Destiny pendulum for high and low RPM weapons. Vulpecula has several fourth column perks that change that equation, granting you damage bonuses while retaining the ease of use. While I believe 180s will be consistently off-meta picks, you can certainly have some serious, high-performing fun with them in sixes.
