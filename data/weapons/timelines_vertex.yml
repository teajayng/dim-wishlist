overview: >
  This Timelines' Vertex is the randomly-rolled successor to the Future 
  War Cult version of the same name from days gone by. While it uses a
  reskinned version of the Erentil, it is unfortunately not also a High-
  Impact Frame. Fusions had a pretty nasty nerf in S11, discussed in
  [roll comments](#hollow-words---pvp) on the
  Hollow Words.
