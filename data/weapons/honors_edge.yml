overview: >
  Honor's Edge (HE) is available in the World Drops loot pool in Season 11,
  originally being re-issued back in Season 10. The main difference between
  HE and SS14 is that HE can roll with `Surrounded` and `Flash Counter`,
  two both amazing perks.


  * `Surrounded` + `Surrounded Spec` ends up giving you a massive 35%
  damage increase and since a Sword is in-your-face there's a high chance
  you'll proc this regularly.

  * `Flash Counter` not only disorients but 
  [applies a 20% debuff](https://youtu.be/b9HcFqLdlyQ?t=1477)!
  This means
  *all incoming damange* is upped by 20%. You can imagine how helpful this
  would be in Public Events (like the S11 Contact event), to debuff the
  boss with up to eleven other Guardians attacking. The debuff lasts for
  five seconds, so you'll need to periodically switch to blocking for this
  to take effect. Given that every boss in the game stomps, this is a great
  way to take out your anti-stomp rage ðŸ˜¡


  Fortunately the perk set is very small and chances are you'll get the
  roll you're after relatively quickly? When you do, rejoice! That roll
  will keep you all the way through Season 13.
