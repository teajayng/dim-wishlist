overview: >  
  Crimil's is a 110 RPM Kinetic, Aggressive Frame Hand Cannon that has been
  re-issued in Season 11 with a higher power cap. It features the same perk
  pool its always had and since 110s haven't been touched over the years
  dince Destiny 2's launch, it's going to be a pretty limited set of perks
  we're interested in.
