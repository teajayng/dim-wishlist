overview: >
  The Seventh Seraph Carbine (SSC) is a 450 RPM Precision Frame Kinetic
  Auto Rifle. Let's start with a quick comparison to randomly-rolled 450s,
  over on
  [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=BdCxNP;mJ1-6;Bqp0Wx;Fju9i;DmTiv3).
  In general the 450s are fairly the same stat-wise, with a material
  deviation in Aim Assist for the SSC; easily addressable with an Aim Assist
  mod.

  I personally love ARs, so I played with a
  [zero-Recoil, high Stability](https://d2gunsmith.com/w/DY2Aqw8sOokyOvhv0Wv1Ehw9zBP2FwQRxW2Ig9KX1MIo3LEpW)
  roll for several Iron Banner games, with both Targeting and Unflinching mods
  equippted. I immediately wanted to go back to using my 600 RPM AR with Moving
  Target and Tap the Trigger :) The Carbine, any any 450 RPM AR, feels a bit
  slower than the pace of Crucible (YMMV).


  If you're a fan of ARs or even just the SSC itself, why not pick one up and
  vault it just in case the meta changes? Here are a few things to keep in mind:


  * The lower the RPM the higher the range, and falloff for a base range SSC
  starts ~30m which is quite far in-game; probably at the maximum range
  you'd choose to engage with an Auto Rifle anyway.

  * I'm passing on `Threat Detector` for PvP because at 15m, you're going to
  feel like switching to your special weapon.

  * With a base `Recoil` of `74`, you're fine there. I shot a few magazines into
  a wall with `100` and the pattern was the same. Do not put on a
  `Counterbalance` mod or else you'll ruin the recoil pattern. 


  Here's a few rolls worth considering that you can put to work today!

  I always suggest picking up at least one good PvE roll of any weapon that can
  generate Warmind Cells, including this one.
