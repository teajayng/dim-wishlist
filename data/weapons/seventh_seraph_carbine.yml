overview: >
  The Seventh Seraph Carbine (SSC) is a 450 RPM "Precision Frame" Kinetic
  Auto Rifle. Let's start with a quick comparison to randomly-rolled 450s,
  over on
  [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=BdCxNP;mJ1-6;Bqp0Wx;Fju9i;DmTiv3).
  In general the 450s are fairly the same stat-wise, with a material
  deviation in Aim Assist for the SSC; easily addressable with an Aim Assist
  mod.
