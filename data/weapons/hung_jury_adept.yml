overview: >
  The Adept Hung Jury is available from Grandmaster Nightfalls. It's the same
  as the Hung Jury, with the exception that it can take Adept mods and gains
  `+2` to all attributes when Masterworked.

  Scout Rifles in PvP still aren't shining but there are some really
  interesting rolls here that you can bolster with insane Adept mods. For
  example, if you slot an `Adept Counterbalance` mod, you'll bring the
  `Recoil` to `100`. Unfortunately that hurts your effective Range taking
  you from 83.36m to 80.05m ðŸ™ƒ

  As Hung Jury drops from an end-game PvE activity, its primary utility is
  in that arena. There are so many good perks in each column that you
  don't really need a wishlist to tell you that `Firefly` is legit, so here
  are a couple of interesting combos.
