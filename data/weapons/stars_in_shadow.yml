overview: >
  Stars in Shadow is a 340 RPM "High-Impact Frame" Energy Pulse Rifle
  introduced in Destiny 2 Year 4 (Beyond Light). See
  [how it compares](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=B6PI-k;BIfK-Z;BFN60K;)
  to the existing High-Impacts that lit up in Season 11. It's a Crucible
  drop and if you're an avid PvP player, you'll be swimming in these rolls
  in no time. It's a solid Pulse Rifle with good base stats, a clean sight
  and a great feel. I'm sure you'll see more coverage in the coming weeks
  as people settle in to Beyond Light and Season 12.
