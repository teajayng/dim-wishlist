overview: >
  Stars in Shadow is a 340 RPM "High-Impact Frame" Energy Pulse Rifle
  introduced in Destiny 2 Year 4 (Beyond Light). See
  [how it compares](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=B6PI-k;BIfK-Z;BFN60K;)
  to the existing High-Impacts that lit up in Season 11. It's a Crucible
  drop and if you're an avid PvP player, you'll be swimming in these rolls
  in no time. It's a solid Pulse Rifle with good base stats, a clean sight
  and a great feel. I'm sure you'll see more coverage in the coming weeks
  as people settle in to Beyond Light and Season 12.


  ***"Why are the odds for these rolls so low?"*** The final two columns
  typically have four to six perks in them. In the case of Stars in Shadow, they
  each have twelve.

  These rolls are going to be similar to those we captured in our
  coverage of
  [Cold Denial](#cold-denial---pvp)
  as it's a comparable 340 RPM.


  ***"Why don't you have any Outlaw or Feeding Frenzy PvP rolls?"***


  Good question! Glove mod slots are inexpensive and not contentious in
  PvP. If you want much faster reload, throw on a two-Energy Pulse Rifle
  Reload mod. Feeding Frenzy was changed to provide a noticeable benefit
  after three successive kills, so I no longer recommend it for PvP.

  In PvE you're going for as much `Range` as you can get with sustained
  damage upkeep. There are some solid perks here not in our rolls, becase
  you don't need this wishlist to tell you that Demolitionist is a good
  perk ðŸ™ƒ
