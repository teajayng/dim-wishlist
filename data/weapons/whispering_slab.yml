  Remember when we all thought Wish-Ender would break the Crucible because
  you could see through walls? That's the last time I thought bows might
  break the sandbox, or really even ever thought about using bows in PvP
  at all. Did you even know you can see through walls with Wish-Ender? I
  digress...


  Many months ago, I saved a post by
  [/u/TheGuiltySpark117](https://www.reddit.com/user/TheGuiltySpark117) in
  the off chance I ever wanted to give bows a real shot in PvP. Over that
  time I've read and re-read it, every time I'm trying to figure out if I
  have a good bow roll. *I strongy suggest you check this out; it's
  phenomenal!*

  donâ€™t see a loadout for whispering slab that would be great for PvE, however.
