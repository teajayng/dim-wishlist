overview: >
  Temptation's Hook is the first "Caster Frame" sword to appear in the game.
  It's Heavy Attack swipe is replaced with a projectile that (at full sword
  energy) grinds away when it hits an enemy. You can make great use of these
  against enemies where peeking is helpful, for example Shriekers or keeping
  a beefy enemy from regenerating its shield.

  `Jagged Edge` is the clear choice for the first column, and since we want to
  throw as many projectiles as we can, it's `Swordmaster's Guard` for the second
  column.
