overview: >
  False Promises is a 360 RPM Kinetic Auto Rifle introduced in Season 11.
  The High-Impacts are notable by their extremely long `Range` and extremely
  poor `Stability` and False Promises is no exception. On console, False
  Promises is pretty tough to control. Even with vertical `Recoil`, there's
  still a lot of bounce in the reticle because the `Stability` is so low.

  I'm recommending, nay requiring `Dynamic Sway Reduction` for any False
  Promises roll I'd consider using in PvP, because of its marked affect on
  `Stability` and `Accuracy`. Here's what
  [Bungie had to say](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/49126)
  about DSR prior to S11:
        

  > **Dynamic Sway Reduction**: Adds 10 Stability over time in addition to accuracy (this is way more powerful than it sounds).
  Reduced reticle movement from Stability should now tell players this is working.


  Here's a couple of videos examining Stability, including the effects of
  DSR. These were recorded before the aforementioned buff, so some of these
  may be a little out of date depending on which part of the content you're
  referring to.

  All of the following rolls feature Eye of the Storm, Rampage and
  Swashbuckler. Think about this from a "forgiveness" perspective. If you
  want more forgiveness during your first exchange, choose Eye of the Storm.
  If you want more foregiveness during follow-on encounters, choose Rampage
  or Swashbuckler.

  In PvE you're going for as much
  `Range` as you can get with sustained damage upkeep.
