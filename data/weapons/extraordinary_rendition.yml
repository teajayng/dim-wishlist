overview: >
  Extraordinary Rendition is a 750 RPM Kinetic Submachine Gun; part of the S13
  weapon set. Both perks and stats are
  [virtually identical](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=BBbEym;BZzrdV)
  to the Cold Front, available only during the 2020 Dawning, so we'll be able
  to rely on the work we did there for these rolls ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ Ehroar covers the

  in depth.


  The cornerstone of both PvE and PvP are `Surplus`. If you end up with a
  "PvE roll" that also happens to have super high Stability, then you've
  got the Holy Grail. Congrats! For an explanation of these rolls, please
  read further down towards the specific PvE and PvP sections.

  EA needs a lot of help in the Stability department, which is the
  entire focus of these two rolls. At best, you'll be able to get Stability
  up from `17` to `52` plus the benefits coming from Surplus and Tap
  the Trigger. This puts you way above the base Stability on the
  vaunted Antiope-D and other Precision Frame SMGs. The Recoil is `97`
  so YMMV on whether or not a Counterbalance mod is required (I
  suggest an Icarus Mod otherwise).


  You'll also notice there are no damage perks in these rolls. Neither Rampage x1
  nor Multikill Clip x1 changes the TTK or TTK requirements materially.

  With `Surplus`, `One for All` and `Frenzy` in the EA perk
  pool, we're looking at a strong contender for one of the best kinetic
  weapons of all time (second only to the Ikelos SMG). `Surplus` improves
  Stability and Reload and `One for All` and `Frenzy` provide a tremendous
  damage boost and leaves your mod slot free for Minor, Major or Boss Spec.
