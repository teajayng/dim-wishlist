overview: >
  The Forward Path is a 600 RPM (Adaptive Frame) Kinetic Auto Rifle, brought
  back to us in Season 11 Iron Banner. It was in the first batch of IB weapons
  that featured the new Iron Gaze and Iron Grip perks.

  The Forward Path, perhaps unsurprisingly given where it drops, is an absolute
  bear in PvP. 600 RPM ARs dominated the S11 meta and even though they were
  slightly reined in, they're still phenomenal. It has terrific base stats
  including the highest Aim Assist (71) of any Adaptive Frame Auto Rifle and is
  just an all-around terrific weapon.

  Forward Path rolls with sights, not barrels, meaning that the appearance and
  effective range can be materially modified by your choice here.


  * **25m**: `Hitmark`, `Cleanshot`

  * **28m**: `Red-Dot Micro`, `Red Dot 2 MOA`

  * **39m**: `Rifle Scope ST`, `Rifle Scope SSF`. Huge, huge `Range` boost with
  a subjectively large sticking point: muzzle flash. The constrained view
  combined with muzzle flash can make target acquisition difficult. *"When you
  get down to 20m, tracking targets becomes an issue."* -

  If you're looking at The Forward Path from the perspective of a PvE player,
  you'll find a standard set of perks from seasons past. As Year 4 rolls on
  and more Kinetic weapons appear with sweet new perks like Surplus,
  Wellspring and One for All, TFP will find trouble shining. These are some
  workhorse rolls that will hold up until that point.
