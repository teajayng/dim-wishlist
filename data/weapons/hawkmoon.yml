overview: >
  Hawkmoon is a 140 RPM Exotic Hand Cannon, re-issued from Destiny 1 featuring
  random rolls! The base stats are terrific and it's hard to argue that any
  single roll is "bad" per se, but there are certainly some rolls that are more
  desireable than others from a min/max'ers perspective.
