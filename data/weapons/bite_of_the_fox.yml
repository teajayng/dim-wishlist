overview: >
  Bite of the Fox is a Kinetic-slot, Aggressive Frame sniper. It's been in
  the Iron Banner loot pool since Season 4 and has been re-issued in Season
  11. This means if you *had* a BOTF, it will hit the level cap this season,
  so you'll want to get a new roll to take you past Season 11.

  Aggressive Frame snipers are the only ones that can one-shot every super
  in the Crucible. Every super has a different damage-resistance tier that
  affects your ability to do that however Aggressive Frames do not care
  about such things.


  The perk pool is unchanged in the re-issue, so we have a pretty simple
  set of rolls we're chasing.

  There's no Triple-
  Tap, Fourth Time's the Charm, Vorpal, etc. so I'd suggest you use
  something else in PvE in the Kinetic slot. If you absolutely had to have
  one, maybe [`Firmly Planted` + `Field Prep`]?
