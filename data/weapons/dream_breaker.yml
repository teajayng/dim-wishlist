overview: >
  Dream Breaker is an Adaptive Frame Solar Fusion Rifle, originally released way back in the Shadowkeep days. It came back to us in S14 with a revamped set of perks that at the time, made for an underwhelming package. In S15, Bungie revamped Fusion Rifles and given the right perks and right playstyle (which I suppose is true for any weapon), the Dream Breaker can put in work.
