overview: >
  Season 11 is the first time we've seen Berenger's Memory since Destiny 2
  Year 1 (i.e. Season 1). It's the first time it's been available with
  random rolls. It's a Rapid-Fire Frame with an interesting perk layout that
  doesn't ultimately result in a lot of super interesting rolls.

  All of the best perks are in the final column. There are OK perks in the
  third column but nothing that super synergizes moreso than the other GLs that
  can roll in this slot.
