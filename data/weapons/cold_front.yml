  Cold Front is a 750 RPM Aggressive Frame ("High damage, high recoil") Kinetic
  Submachine Gun, first introduced long ago during the Season 9 Dawning event.
  It's back once again with a whole new set of perks from Year 4. If you want to
  see the old perks, here's a still from

  > *I have a reason to believe this is the new best primary in the game, full stop* -- Blyatnid, Dec. 2020


  Ehroar and co. are excited for a couple of reasons. First, Cold Front has an
  (obviously) higher rate of fire than its 600 RPM counterpart without being
  all that much different stat-wise (save for Stability of course). It can also 
  roll with the new damage-boosting perk `One for All` which we'll get to down
  in the PvE section below.


  If you remember the Cold Front from last year, you'll recall its
  Stability is one of the lowest in the game at `16`. Technically that's
  "better" than Hard Truth's `15` though not by much. This is less of an
  issue on PC than Console, though it's still an issue. However, this time
  around we have two new tools at our disposal: `Surplus` and `Dynamic Sway
  Reduction`.


  The cornerstones of both PvE and PvP are `Surplus` and `Dynamic Sway
  Reduction`. The best PvE and PvP rolls center around having one of these
  perks in column three. If you end up with a "PvE roll" that also happens
  to have super high Stability, then you've got the Holy Grail of Cold
  Front rolls. Congrats! For an explanation of these rolls, please read
  further down towards the specific PvE and PvP sections.


  These rolls are floored at `36` Stability (before `Surplus`) since that's
  the base Stability of other similar SMGS (e.g. Ikelos).

        
  *Yes, these rolls are all based on quotes from the great
  [Dr. Victor Fries](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118688/characters/nm0000216#quotes).*

  You'll notice I didn't include any final column perks. Rampage doesn't
  meaningfully realistically alter the TTK and Thresh adds so little to
  your super that it's not worth calling out as the Collector's Edition.
  Whatever you get in that final column is fine.

  With the addition of `Surplus` and `One for All` to the Cold Front perk
  pool, we're looking at a strong contender for one of the best kinetic
  weapons of all time. `Surplus` improves Stability and Reload (two big Cold
  Front drawbacks) and `One for All` provides a tremendous damage boost
  and leaves your mod slot free for Minor, Major or Boss Spec.
