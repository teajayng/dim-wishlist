  **(Rolls have been added, updated and removed based on the changes in the December 2021 Dawning event. The most noticeable difference is the removal/reliance on `Surplus` which took a huge transitive hit by how much slower abilities are to recharge now.)**


  Cold Front is a 750 RPM Aggressive Frame ("High damage, high recoil") Kinetic Submachine Gun, first introduced long ago during the Season 9 Dawning event. It's back once again with its yearly refresh of the perk pool. Keep in mind these reviews are from 2020. Its primary utility is in PvE, but we'll include a PvP configuration if you happent to land the magical combination of perks that make it viable.

  The Multimach and Shayura's are best-in-slot for Kinetic and Energy respectively, and have phenomenally better base stats than the Cold Front. With Cold Front you're spending so much of your roll trying to deal with it's terriblly low `Stability` that you don't leave room for perks on top of that. If you landed the perfect set of Stability perks and a Stability Masterwork you could have something interesting to work with, so we'll include that roll.
