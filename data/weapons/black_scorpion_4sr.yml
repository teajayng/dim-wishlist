  [CoolGuy's review (8/2019)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQt0MDS9JY)
  is great source of info for the Black Scorpion, as well as the Massive 
  Breakdown Podcast [Ep. 148](https://soundcloud.com/destinymassivebreakdowns/episode-148-bygones-last-perdition-and-black-scorpion-4sr-breakdowns).
  There are seven perks in the final two columns (versus the usual four to
  six) and during Season 9, this weapon does not benefit from the Rank 92
  extra-final-column-perk bonus. That means these rolls are going to be
  super challenging to get, so we're going to relax a few constraints along
  the way.


  * Recoil is `60`, so using a Counterbalance mod to make it vertical is a
  slam dunk. Check out CoolGuy's video for a
  [before/after](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQt0MDS9JY&t=400).

  * All these rolls will recommend Rampage in the final column because
  "Rampage x 1 will kill with four crits in 0.7s."

  * The base Range hits max damage at 68m which you're not going to find
  often on a PvP map, so we're OK with it. We don't want to harm the range,
  but this roll isn't dying for more range. Mercules904 - "The 2x zoom blows
  through your range requirements. I really just like this gun more with a
  heck of a lot of Stability."

  * Zen Moment? YES. Stability is where our focus will be. Zen Moment gives
  you a bump to your base Stability which you can see
  [here](https://youtu.be/uElV7xVFN6Q?t=280) and the base Stability is a
  terrific `54`, the highest among all Scout Rifles (?!).

  * No Outlaw? NOPE. The reload is already plenty fast and there's no DPS
  perk to play off of in column three. It's not bad, it's just not
  make-or-break.

  [nKuch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc87SDsCrIQ) to see the Black
  Scorpion in action. I was surprised to hear how much Mercules904 digs the
  Black Scorpion (it's the weapon he used to get Randy's).
