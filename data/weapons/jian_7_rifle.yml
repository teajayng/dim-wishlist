overview: >
  This Jian 7 is the randomly-rolled successor to the New Monarchy Pulse
  of the same name from days gone by. It's a 390RPM Adaptive Pulse Rifle
  which is mostly the same as the Last Perdition which also rolls in this
  slot. The most important difference is that the Jian's base recoil is
  `80` which means that with a Counterbalance mod, it will be effectively
  perfectly vertical at `95`. Contrast with the Last Perdition whose base
  Recoil is `63` (
