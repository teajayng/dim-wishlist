overview: >
  Jian 7 is the randomly-rolled successor to the New Monarchy Pulse of the same
  name from days gone. It's a 390RPM Adaptive Pulse Rifle which is similar to
  the Last Perdition which also rolls in this slot.
  
  
  * The Jian's base recoil is `80` which means that with a Counterbalance mod,
  it will be trend mostly vertical at `95`. Contrast with the Last Perdition
  whose base Recoil is `63`.

  * Perks are mostly similar with some slotting variations. There are no Rampage-
  based perks here because it doesn't make it any easier to off enemies unless
  you're at x 2 which is too situational for a solid recommendation.


  Most everything written for the Last Perdition applies here as well.
