overview: >
  The Seventh Seraph SAW is a 360 RPM, High-Impact Frame, Arc Machine Gun
  that first appeared in Season 10. MGs haven't been bananas in PvE for some
  time (save for the Xenopage), and so in the
  [final TWAB of Season 14](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/50572)
  Bungie announced that they're increasing PvE damage of Machine Guns by 25%.


  In lieu of being able to find anyone covering the SAW, I looked for coverage
  of other 360 RPM Machine Guns. Drewsky has a great review of the
  [Bane of Sorrow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7hqmrV1pk0) another 360 RPM
  MG that used to drop in the Crown of Sorrow raid. The basic sandbox science
  there informed much of these rolls.

  Given Heavy ammo availability in Crucible (perhaps save for Mayhem), focus on
  Legendary heavy weapons tends to be rather low. That being said, we can still
  pick one up because why not? Good to have on hand in case a new game mode is
  released or the sandbox updates.


  The SAW hits for 48 crit / 38 body (TTK 0.5s / 0.83s). It's got terrific range
  and flinches like crazy. It can roll with `Opening Shot` in the final column.
  With the rate of fire being so low, you can single tap out shots and get crits
  across the map. Try out some Machine Gun sniping and let me know how that works
  out for you 🎯 (non-sarcastically 🙃)

  This is going to be a long one because I haven't found any super detailed
  coverage of the SAW (or any other Seraph weapon save for the Hand Cannon).
  Fortunately since a High-Impact is a High-Impact (at base), Drewsky has
  a great review of the
  [Bane of Sorrow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7hqmrV1pk0)
  that's definitely worth watching! The SAW can't roll with most of the
  perks he discussed in that video, but it's relevant to consider the points
  he raises.


  * Perhaps most important, it's a Seraph weapon which means it generates Warmind
  Cells if you have Warmind mods equipped.

  * As a High-Impact Frame, the SAW keeps anything it doesn't kill
  practically stun-locked. As the difficulty of PvE content increases, this
  becomes super important. Even if you're not doing Grandmaster Nightfalls,
  flinching challenging adds sure makes things more straightforward.

  * Its base effective `Range` is amazing. Damage falloff starts ~45m and is
  reasonable up to ~50m (-5%). You're talking maximum damage at Scout Rifle
  ranges. At maximum range, the sight overlaps your target because MGs
  don't have high-zoom sights/scopes. *This is why I'm not
  suggesting any `Range` boosting below - when I pushed the `Range` to `93`
  falloff and floors were unchanged and the recoil/handling will make it
  challenging to stay on target anyway.*

  * It's the only Machine Gun that can roll with `Vorpal` or `Firing Line` in
  the final column, which provide 15% and 25% damage boosts, respectively.
  Those are substantial increases to damage without requiring a kill or reload
  to activate. 


  Let's step through all the perks in the final two columns:


  * Column 3:
    * ✅`Field Prep` is far and away the winner. It grants a whopping 25%
    more in reserve (223 to 278), speeds up your reload time by two seconds
    (~5.5s to ~3.5s) and increases ready and stow speed. Within 45m at
    1,222 to 1,716 damage, that's an extra 67k - 94k damage available to you.

    * ❌`Auto-Loading Holster` and `Grave Robber` are the other two reload
    perks in this column and neither is worth giving up the reserve and
    handling bonuses that `Field Prep` provides.
        
  * Column 4:
    * ✅`Firing Line`: 20% precision damage boost when near two teammates. In
    PvE content you're nearly always near your fireteam and especially so in
    GMs. It has double utility in dealing with adds and on boss DPS and since
    the SAW fires so slowly you can get those precision shots in.

    * ✅`Vorpal`: 15% damage boost to bosses and Champions. It's a solid pick
    if you don't have one with `Firing Line`.

    * ❌`Mulligan`: Nope. You shouldn't be missing that many shots and the
    opportunity cost of Mulligan is too high. "So Slif you're telling me to 
    git gud?" At maximum effective SAW range, I was hitting at least 50% crits
    at the base `Recoil` and no `Stability` boosts. You will too!

    * ❌`Opening Shot`: This is interesting because at 360 RPM you can tap
    out one bullet at a time, turning this in to kind of an incredibly
    high-impact Scout Rifle. Situationally cool but you can still use the SAW
    like this just fine without it. Arguably more of an off-meta PvP pick.

    * ❌`Elemental Capacitor`: While large, the effect of any of these
    increases pales in comparison to significantly higher damage output. You
    can also get each of the benefits through other perks or armor mods. This
    isn't a case in general against `Capacitor`, just on this particular
    weapon.

    * ❌`Disruption Break`: A 50% Kinetic damage bonus debuff is nothing to
    sneeze at! This is a niche pick for when you're up against Arc shields
    because in a Match Game activity, you won't do enough damage to break
    non-matching shields. Myself, if I'm hopping in to a difficult PvE
    activity I'm going to get more general, always-on use from Firing Line.

  We'll surround our choice of perks with `Stability`-bumping selections.
