overview: >
  The SI-2 is the 2020 version of the Anonymous Autumn (Kyt: *"which is the
  best-in-class for lightweight sidearms"*) and is the only other randomly
  rolled 360 RPM Energy sidearm. Mercules is on the same page: *"It (SI-2)
  doesn't have great Stability or great Range. I would pick a well-rolled
  Anonymous Autumn over this every time."* Why do they say that? It's got
  basically the same stats as an Anonymous Autumn but has 33% less Range
  and 20% less Stability. On the plus side the SI-2 has 7% better Handling
  (64 > 69) 🙃
