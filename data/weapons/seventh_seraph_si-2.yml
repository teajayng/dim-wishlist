  TrueVanguard, who absolutely loves the Anonymous Autumn (with over
  14,000 kills) depicts the SI-2 as situational, relying primarily on Vorpal
  to justify using it. Check out

  If you are going to consider the SI-2 for PvP, a few things to keep in
  mind. The recoil direction is 95, so no need to worry about straightening it
  out. It doesn't have great Range and there's no escaping that. You can
  dump all of your options into Range and you're going to extend the ADS dropoff
  by a whopping +0.5m. I would suggest looking for high-Stability options.

  Like all other Seraph weapons, the SI-2 contributes to the generation
  of Warmind cells in PvE. Since it also comes up in the Seasonal artifact as a
  Champion-stunner, it's perhaps a good idea to keep a decent roll around.
