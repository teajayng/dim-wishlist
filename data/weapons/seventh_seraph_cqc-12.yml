overview: >
  The CQC-12 is an 80 RPM "Lightweight Frame" shotgun in the energy slot.
  There are only four perks in the final two columns meaning you're more likely
  to get a decent roll more quickly.
  
  
  See how it compares to other randomly-rolled Lightweights over on 
  [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=BslVBs;CEKlVP;Brud8B;DmKQYw).
  Statistically, they're
  all quite similar and like most shotguns, otherwise identical in barrels
  and magazines.


  Most important, the CQC-12 looks and sounds *amazing*, and that's like 80% of
  the reason to use a weapon anyway, right?? ðŸ˜œ

  With the Season 14/15 sandbox changes, there's a slight change to some
  suggested shotgun rolls. The Lightweight frame mobility bonus and some of the
  roll possiilities make this a solid PvP choice.

  Since this is a Seraph weapon, it's capable of generating Warmind Cells.
  Whenever shotguns end up being a Champion-stunner, you'll want one for
  that too.
