overview: >
  The CQC-12 is an 80 RPM "Lightweight Frame" shotgun in the energy slot.
  Through leveling the season pass, you unlock a chance for it to drop at
  the conclusion of Gambit, Crucible and Strike activities. You can't really
  "farm" it per se. The good news is that there's only four perks in the
  final two columns meaning it's not incredibly difficult to get the perks
  you might be interested in. See how it compares to other randomly-rolled
  80 RPMs over on 
  [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=BslVBs;CEKlVP;Brud8B;DmKQYw).
  Statistically, they're
  all quite similar and like all shotguns, otherwise identical in barrels
  and magazines.
