  Jurassic Green has high competition in the Energy slot for S-tier Rapid-Fire Pulse Rifles. That competition comes in the form of Darkest Before and Gridskipper, both of which are are easily farmable. If you have a terrifc roll on either, consensus is you can skip Jurassis Green entirely. However, as Sheikh (aka Destiny Fun Police) calls out in his video review, there is... something... about how it feels that might make it superior to those others for you.
  
  
  Personally I love the way Jurassic Green looks and feels so I'll be farming for a few myself. See you in the Haunted Lost Sectors!

  We'll be factoring all of these into our rolls, though there's largely consensus on what is desired.

  There are several solid PvE perks available. Since I'm not a fan of carpal tunnel syndrome or athritis, I personally can't use Rapid-Fire Pulse Rifles in PvE unless they can roll with Full Auto. Fortunately that could be change soon with a [new accessibility option](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/50745)!
