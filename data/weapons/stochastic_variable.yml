  The Stochastic Variable is a 900 RPM SMG initially introduced as part of
  the Faction Rallies event and was part of the Future War Cult loot pool.
  It was reintroduced with random rolls in S14 and has access to some of the
  new perks introduced with Beyond Light, but none of the S14-specific new
  perks (e.g. `Danger Zone`).
