overview: >
  Shadow Price is a 450 RPM Precision Frame, Arc Energy Auto Rifle, offered
  as a Nightfall-exclusive reward beginning in Season 13. It's the only 450 RPM
  Auto Rifle dropping apart from the Kinetic Seventh Seraph Carbine;
  [compare them](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=Cc8zza;BdCxNP)
  over on light.gg. Shadow Price has by far the better perk pool (One for All,
  Surplus, Feeding Frenzy...) whereas the Carbine can create Warmind Cells,
  which alone is a reason to use it.

  450s haven't been great in PvP since the first year of Destiny 2. 600 RPMs
  like the Gnawing Hunger and Summoner still reign supreme, and will continue
  to do so until 450s are buffed. What makes the Shadow
  Price even less desirable for PvP is the lack of PvP perks that AR users
  would find interesting in either column. No Dynamic Sway, Tap the Trigger,
  etc. which makes sense since it's a reward for a PvE activity. Once the
  Grandmaster NFs appear and Adept mods are accessible, perhaps Adept
  Counterbalance, Stability, etc. could make it more desireable. Really
  though, until they're buffed, 450 RPMs may be frustrating to deploy against
  meta weapons.

  450s (and ARs in general) are in a tough spot for PvE.
  [Ehroar demonstrates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yeyr60J8K6A)
  this comprehensively: they have a confusing damage profile compared to
  other alternatives in that slot. If Shadow Price were a kinetic, perhaps
  less so, but the Energy slot is so loaded with great weapons that it's
  hard to imagine this being your top choice in its current state. That
  being said, frame buffs are always a thing and 450s seem long overdue
  for one!
