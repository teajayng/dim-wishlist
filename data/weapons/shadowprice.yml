overview: >
  Shadow Price is a 450 RPM Precision Frame, Arc Energy Auto Rifle, offered
  as a Nightfall-exclusive reward beginning in Season 13. It's the only 450 RPM
  Auto Rifle dropping apart from the Kinetic Seventh Seraph Carbine;
  [compare them](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=Cc8zza;BdCxNP)
  over on light.gg. Shadow Price has by far the better perk pool (One for All,
  Surplus, Feeding Frenzy...) whereas the Carbine can create Warmind Cells,
  which alone is a reason to use it.
