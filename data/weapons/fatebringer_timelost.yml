overview: >
  This is the "Timelost" (or "Adept") version of this weapon, which drops only by completing the Conflux encounter Challenge in Vault of Glass on Master mode. Once obtained, you can spend `Spoils of Conquest` for random rolls after defeating Atheon in Master mode.  The rolls here are the same as the [normal version]({{< ref "/docs/vog/fatebringer" >}} "normal version").


  Fatebringer, Timelost Edition:


  * Bonus Third Column Perk: `Explosive Payload`
  * Bonus Fourth Column Perk: `Firefly`
  * Can slot Adept mods!


  "I don't get it. Then why is my Timelost Fatebringer marked as a PvP roll?"


  DIM matches only one roll at a time, based on the order specified in the wishlist. To avoid *all* Timelost rolls being marked as the best PvE roll (i.e. ignoring all the other possible rolls you might have had), we've made it the last roll in the list. Have no fear, you do indeed have a phenomenal PvE roll, no matter what Timelost roll drops üòç
