overview: >
  Farewell is a Lightweight frame, 360 RPM Sidearm introduced in S14. It's the
  only Kinetic Lightweight available in the game, and the only *other* sidearm
  [of that type](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=gQd-h;DqtxKU)
  entirely.

  With the recent nerf to 120RPM HCs and Aggressive frame shotguns (well,
  all shotguns really), sidearms now have more of a chance to shine.
  Farewell has some of the amazing new perks on it. Have a look at
  TrueVanguard's latest:

  I'm personally not a fan of single-shot sidearms in PvE. Yes this can roll
  with `Full Auto` but `Full Auto` on single-shot sidearms kicks way too much.
  Even so, dramatically outweighed by nearly every other option you'll have
  in the Kinetic slot for PvE.
