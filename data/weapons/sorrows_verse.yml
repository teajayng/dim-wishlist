overview: >
  Sorrow's Verse is a 600 RPM Adaptive Frame Auto Rifle that drops in the Crucible, starting in S15. These playlist drops have notoriously deep perk pools, so your chance of getting precisely the roll you want is pretty slim. Fortunately the perk pool has a great selection of phenomenal perks!

  600 RPM Auto Rifles are as good as Auto Rifles get in the Crucible, slightly nerfed from their glory days but still the best subtype as of this writing in early S15 (September, 2021). Sorrow's Verse has a massive array of perk combinations that can put in serious work.

  600 RPM Autos are terrific in PvE as well. My Gnawing Hunger with Subsistence and Swashbuckler has just shy of 6,000 kills.
