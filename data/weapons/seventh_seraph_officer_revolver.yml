overview: >
  The Officer Revolver is a 180 RPM Kinetic Hand Cannon that first appeared
  in Season 10. By today's standards, it's perk pool feels a bit dated
  however it maintains relevancy for two key reasons: it's a Seraph weapon
  so it generates Warmind Cells and it's one of the rare weapons that drops
  with `Timed Payload`, useful in both PvP and PvE.

  Meta-wise, 180s are not the play however that doesn't mean you can't make
  magic with them in PvP. They won't be your Trials/Comp first pick.


  Let's check out
  [Drewsky's thoughts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3kCNDYUnzM),
  who finds the novel perks like Firmly Planted and Timed Payload
  worth strong consideration. Notably, he had previously
  [released a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IevtKKR_YxM)
  wishing for more Hand Cannons to have Firmly Planted.

  > **Drewsky:** *"I think this is actually a pretty competitive group of stats
  especially compared to a lot of the other 180 RPM hand cannons. What makes it
  special is that it has a group of pretty competitive stats; maybe not the best
  stats but maybe the best perk pool in combination with those stats available
  on a 180... Suggest prioritizing Range while giving the best overall stat
    package possible."*

  180s tend to have quite high Stability and Aim Assist, so prioritizing Range
  when possible sounds about right. The Officer Revolver also ships with `84`
  Recoil which is mostly vertical, so there's no need to throw on a
  Counterbalance mod.

  The Offcier Revolver is a Seraph weapon which means it can generate Warmind
  Cells. This alone means you'll want to hold on to a decent PvE roll. Second,
  it can roll with Vorpal which helps when Hand Cannons rotate around as
  Seasonal Artifact Champion stunners.
