overview: >
  Chroma Rush is one of the many beautiful new weapons available in S14. It's
  a 720 RPM Rapid-Fire Frame Auto Rifle; the only available in the game apart
  from Arctic Haze. See how they compare
  [over on light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=BCvcwA;BP3N0;).
  Artic Haze suffered from a punishing base recoil and a
  lack of stability and damage-dealing perks whereas Chroma has both of those
  in spades.

  AR's were most recently meta a few seasons back when the 600 RPM variant
  dominated the Crucible. They've since been tuned a bit and haven't
  seen much play since the dawn of 120 RPM Hand Cannons. 720s are a bit more
  interesting since presumably a faster rate of fire means more flinch, and
  flinch is how ARs win gunfights against their slower, more stable-shooting
  brethren.

        
  * As a 720 RPM Auto, Chroma's base Aim Assist and Stability are very good.
  I'd like to avoid spending the core slots on perks that provide incremental
  benefits to those very good stats, like `Dynamic Sway Reduction` or
  `Tap the Trigger`. These perks buff already strong core attributes. **Don't
  get me wrong; they're phenomenal perks, but you already knew that.**
        
  * I'm also avoiding an emphasis on `Range`. If you spend every column on
  maximizing `Range`, you're adding a whopping 3m of falloff at the cost of
  otherwise S-tier perks.
        
  * Its base Recoil is 45 and I've made great use of several rolls that have
  no `Recoil`-adjusting Barrels.


  All of that being said, nearly **every perk** in the final two columns is
  terrific. E.g. `Thresh` is great, but I'm not calling it out here because
  you don't need a wishlist to tell you it's a good perk (i.e. it needs to
  harmonize with another perk or combo of perks on the weapon to warrant
  being part of a roll.)

  I absolutely love 720 RPM Autos in PvE; perhaps my favourite weapon type
  across all of Destiny. I was sad to see my beloved
  [Steelfeather Repeater](https://www.light.gg/db/items/1251729046/steelfeather-repeater/)
  be sunset but c'est la vie. Of the new perks on Chroma Rush (`Heating Up`,
  `Tunnel Vision` and `Adrenaline Junkie`), only `Adrenaline Junkie` is
  compelling in PvE. It does work, but only in niche situations where you
  can keep your grenades up. Sure there are builds that can do that, but you
  don't need this wishlist to tell you that you're looking for a single perk.


  Here we're going with old reliable combos. `Subsistence` was recently
  buffed to ease off the penalty to your reserves, and is an absolute
  S-tier perk now.
