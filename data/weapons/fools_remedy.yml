overview: >
  Fool's Remedy is "SUROS Rapid-Fire" (i.e. fully automatic) 450 RPM Sidearm
  that has been re-issued in Season 11's Iron Banner. The Remedy is the only
  SUROS-RF sidearm in the game apart from `Dead Man Walking`.


  If you're going to chase a single weapon from Season 11 Iron Banner (thus
  far), the Fool's Remedy is the one to go for. People are raving about it
  because of how it performs at base, its available perks, and that those
  perks now include the new Iron Banner specific perks: `Iron Gaze` and
  `Iron Grip`.

  As is pleasantly becoming the norm in Season 11, it's hard to pick a single
  "god roll" for this sidearm. We're trending towards a lack of
  unequivocally "best" rolls (or even best-per-input-type) and that's going
  to make the Destiny sandbox a lot more interesting, especially as the
  first batch of weapons sunset this season.
