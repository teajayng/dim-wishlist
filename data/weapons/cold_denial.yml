overview: >
  Cold Denial is a 340 RPM "High-Impact Frame" Kinetic Pulse Rifle
  introduced in Season 11. See
  [how it compares](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=BIfK-Z;C-tvt8;BFN60K;MZyyP)
  to the existing High-Impacts. The major difference might seem like a minor
  one, but check out the `Zoom:14` compared to the others with `Zoom:18`.
  The lower zoom means you've got a wider FOV while zoomed in, and that
  small(er) thumbstick movements don't kick your reticle as much. It makes
  way more of a difference than it might seem like on paper.

  Everyone is covering this Pulse Rifle because it's absolutely amazing.
  Check out

  and I'm sure you'll see more coverage in the coming weeks as more folks
  get their hands on various rolls.


  The headline perk here is `Killing Wind`. The decent Stability and low
  Zoom factor downplay the need for the only other alternative:
  `Zen Moment`. Check out CoolGuy's review of
  [Killing Wind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go1TYsXCopc&feature=youtu.be&t=420)
  Here's are the benefits as he describes them:


  * `Killing Wind` has a five second duration. Additional kills refresh the
  duration.

  * It adds roughly five tiers of Mobility with the attendant benefits
  (strafe speed, etc.).

  * It adds roughly a 4m increase in damage falloff.

  * The Range boost it provides "is like a sustained version of `Opening
  Shot`".

  * Handling increase is on par with Snapshot and vastly improved stow
  speed.


  The last column is interesting. A handful of perks elevate the roll but
  in my opinion, none are essential. Headseeker might seem strange but
  with the High-Impact buff in S11, it means a 4H2B kill instead of 5H2B on
  6 resilience or less. Think about it as making your initial engagement 
  more forgiving whereas Multikill Clip and Swashbuckler make your follow-on
  engagements more forgiving.

  There's not much to puzzle out here. In PvE you're going for as much
  `Range` as you can get with sustained damage upkeep. I think `Unrelenting`
  is a super interesting perk, I would just prefer to have the large damage
  bonuses active from damage-boosting perks.
