overview: >
  "First In, Last Out" was released for the first time in Season 11 since
  its initial drop at the launch of Destiny 2 - Season 1! It's the first
  time we've seen this with random rolls, so it does have a contemporary
  set of perks available (e.g. Demoiltionist and Vorpal). With the S14
  shotgun nerf, and the mid-2020 precision damage PvE buff for Shotguns,
  (quoted below) this one should be at the top of your list.

  Slug shotguns have always been an acquired taste and nothing about the `First
  In, Last Out` changes that. It can do great work in the right hands. Grab
  some Range- and Accuracy-boosting perks and you'll be all set.

  In the 5/21/2020 TWAB, Bungie announced a surprising buff to slug
  shotguns:

  > Slug Shotguns are underused in PvE, because they require crits to
  maximize damage, and didnâ€™t reward that precision with higher damage
  per second: `Slug Shotgun PvE Damage + 30%`.


  This rocketed slugs to the top of the boss DPS leaderboards. Definitely
  pick one up.
