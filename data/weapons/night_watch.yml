overview: >
  Night Watch is a 200 RPM Scout Rifle that dropped during Season of the
  Drifter (S6). It has been re-issued in Season of Arrivals (S11) and is
  the only 200 RPM Scout Rifle in the game that is currently available.
  [CoolGuy's review (5/2019)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1KGJ7WU9es)
  remains a great source of info for Night Watch. It's a bit over a year
  old, but the sandbox hasn't changed materially around 200 RPM Scouts (for
  better or worse) or the perks he talks through.
