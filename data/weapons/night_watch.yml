overview: >
  Night Watch is a 200 RPM Scout Rifle that dropped during Season of the
  Drifter (S6). It has been re-issued in Season of Arrivals (S11) and is
  the only 200 RPM Scout Rifle in the game that is currently available.
  [CoolGuy's review (5/2019)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1KGJ7WU9es)
  remains a great source of info for Night Watch. It's a bit over a year
  old, but the sandbox hasn't changed materially around 200 RPM Scouts (for
  better or worse) or the perks he talks through.
pvp_comments: >
  200 RPM Scouts (including the Night Watch) are far from meta. Even the
  strongest of the bunch (MIDA) you never see. The maps aren't really
  designed for Scouts, perhaps save for Rusted Lands? and 200 RPM Scouts
  struggle against the powerhouses like Jade Rabbit.


  And now the section where I feel like I have to justify not just picking
  Outlaw + Rampage/Kill Clip on every weapon in the game ðŸ˜ƒ


  * I am not suggesting Outlaw because the base `Reload` is already plenty
  fast. Outlaw isn't bad here per se, there's just not a strong reason to
  choose it.

  * Conversely, I am suggesting Rapid Hit because even though it was
  [changed in S11](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/49126),
  it's still a solid perk.

  * I am not suggesting Rampage because at x1 it does not alter the
  TTK (it does at x2).

  * Conversely, I am suggesting Multikill Clip because it does alter the
  TTK (3H1B > 3H0B).


  Similar to my thoughts on 180 RPM Hand Cannons, I do think Explosive
  Payload is very strong here. The explosions have no damage falloff and
  with the high rate of fire, it means your target is constantly flinched
  (almost annoying so). Here's a 
  [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0uI-KZnD70)
  from Drewsky demonstrating how High Caliber Rounds and Explosive Payload
  work.

  > "[Explosive Rounds] made the crosshairs jerk horizontally while rising
  and reaching its peak resulting in more irregular and disorienting
  flinch patterns [than High-Caliber Rounds]."


  Because of the high RPM, I'm also going to suggest we shoot for as much
  `Stability` as we can get to increase the recovery of the Aim Assist
  cone between shots.

  Classic combos carry the day here - reload perks combined with damage
  boosting perks, and as much Range as we can get.
