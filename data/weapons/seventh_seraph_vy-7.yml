  The VY-7 is basically an Energy-slot Antiope-D as the basic stat variances are
  immaterial in practice.


  **"Why don't any of these rolls value `Range`?"** The difference between the base
  range of `59` and let's say `80` (using Accurized Rounds, etc.) buys you about
  a whopping one meter of falloff (~16 to ~17m). I don't value buffing Range all
  that highly on the VY-7. It's not that it's *bad* per se, it's just that the
  opportunity cost is high.


  I would strongly suggest getting the Recoil to 100 either via a Barrel
  perk or a `Counterbalance`. Even though its base Recoil is `91` it's still a
  hot mess to control, esp. with its low Handling. For the rolls below I'm going
  to assume you're rolling with a `Counterbalance` Mod installed.

  The VY-7 is the only SMG that's able to roll with Vorpal and you'll want
  one of these for two reasons:

        
  * The VY-7 is a Seraph weapon and contributes to the generation of Warmind
  Cells.

  * SMGs are often eligible for certain Artifact weapon mods.
        

  ...so let's come up with some rolls that help shred Champions and generate
  Warmind Cells (i.e. shred adds).
