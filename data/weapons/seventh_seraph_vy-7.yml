overview: >
  The VY-7 is a 600 RPM Energy "Precision Frame" SMG. Here's how it compares
  to all other randomly-rolled 600 RPM SMGs on
  [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=trStZ;CYr9QP;CQZu7f;B9hF8b;).
  It's competitive base-stat-wise but there's a reason you've probably never
  been killed by any of these weapons (or any SMG for that matter) since the
  first year of Destiny 2. In Season 10 with the recent Adaptive Auto Rifle
  buff, Auto Rifles outclass SMGs and failing ARs, both sidearms and
  shotguns are going to frustrate the hell out of you.
