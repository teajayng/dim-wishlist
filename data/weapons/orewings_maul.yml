overview: >
  Orewing's Maul is a Lightweight Frame, 90RPM Void Grenade Launcher. Orewing's is almost identical to the
  [Truthteller]({{< ref "truthteller">}})
  in every way, though it has a materially different (and less excellent) perk
  pool. Truthteller has more interesting combinations, but that doesn't mean
  Orewing's can't put in work!


  Like Truthteller, Orewing's is part of the "Lightweight Frame" grenade
  launchers (breach-loaded, single shot). Lightweight grenade launchers all
  have a "remote detonation" ability where they detonate when you release
  the trigger (or you get a direct hit). These weapons have a very high
  skill ceiling, allowing banked shots and shots that explode next to
  enemies in cover.

  [Destiny Fun Police](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXhfIXnPTT4)
  (aka DFP) first popularized these back in Year 1 of Destiny 2 when he
  used the Fighting Lion to great affect.


  In PvP, these weapons excel at starting engagements
  rather than finishing them. We want Orewing's to soften our enemies up,
  even if we don't get a direct hit. Remember to pair this with the `Quick
  Access Sling` mod as it'll proc with every shot and let us more quickly
  clean up what we've started.


  Let's talk perks, and why you probably want a Truthteller instead ;)

  * **Column 2**: In PvP, Spike is the winner. You want to maximize OHK chance
  and this is your focus. `Blinding` and `Concussion` grenades are also in this
  column. Blinding grenades flash your screen white and slowly subside whereas
  Concussion grenades jerk your camera dramatically, like being hit by a tether.
  Either Concussion or Blinding grenades are bugged because Blinding's radius is
  massive whereas Concussion requires a near direct hit. With such a wide radius,
  you can practically gaurantee that you'll be able to blind folks in PvP so I
  tend to suggest `Blinding`. What about `Promixity`? The proximity detonation
  radius is so miniscule that you may as well use `Spike` if you're that
  accurate. Firing at enemies in the Tribute Hall and you have to give them a
  buzz cut for `Proximity` to proc.

  * **Column 3**: Only one perk in this column has utility in PvP and
  that's `Quickdraw`.
      
  * **Column 4** : Only one perk in this column has utility in PvP and
  that's Auto-Loading Holster. `Rangefinder`, `Moving Target` and `Snapshot`
  don't help us at all, because you're always hip-firing. `Demolitionist`
  only procs on kills and we're using these to open, not to close. If you
  get any other perk than ALH in this slot, it will unfortunately go to
  waste.


  In the immortal words of
  [@tednaleid](https://github.com/tednaleid)
  "I'm not sure why Bungie created both of these weapons" and it's true!
  It's hard to see why you'd run an Orewing's over a Truthteller. Heck it's
  hard to see why you'd run an Orewing's at all given the two most important
  slots have near zero utility in PvP.

  This section is the same as the
  [Truthteller]({{< ref "truthteller">}}) writeup. The main difference is that
  the perks on Orewing's are different and in different columns, so we don't
  have as many options.
