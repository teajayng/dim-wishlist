overview: >
  Orewing's is almost identical to the
  [Truthteller](#truthteller---pvp)
  in every way, save for a much less excellent perk pool. Truthteller has
  more interesting combinations, but if you're swimming in GL's from Iron
  Banner and really want to keep one, read on.


  [Destiny Fun Police](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXhfIXnPTT4)
  (aka DFP) first popularized these back in Year 1 of Destiny 2 when he
  used the Fighting Lion to great affect.


  Like Truthteller, Orewing's is part of the "Lightweight Frame" grenade
  launchers (breach-loaded, single shot). Lightweight grenade launchers all
  have a "remote detonation" ability where they detonate when you release
  the trigger (or you get a direct hit). These weapons have a very high
  skill ceiling, allowing banked shots and shots that explode next to
  enemies in cover. In PvP, these weapons excel at starting engagements
  rather than finishing them. We want Orewing's to soften our enemies up,
  even if we don't get a direct hit.
