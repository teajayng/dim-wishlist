overview: >
  The BrayTech Werewolf is a 450 RPM "Precision Frame" Kinetic Auto Rifle
  first introduced in Season 8. It's now available in the 2020
  [Festival of the Lost](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Seasons/Events/FestivalOfTheLost)
  event, with random rolls.

  Obtaining this Auto Rifle is a pretty grim affair, behind three levels of
  RNG:

  1. You need Cipher Decoders to drop, which they **have a chance of**
  doing do at the end of most activities (Ordeal, Strike playlist,
  Crucible, etc.).

  1. You need the Werewolf to drop from a Haunted Forest chest. The chance
  appears to be something between "never" and "20%" with most folks
  reporting closer to 5-10%. There's a thread on
  [/r/DestinyTheGame](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/jaeitx/horror_story_werewolf_drop_rate_is_2025_chasing/)
  about it.

  1. You need to get the roll you're chasing.
    
    
  While you are more than welcome to run and grind for these, keep in mind
  that once you obtain a single drop, you can pull a very good PvE static
  roll from your collections. Given that 450 RPM ARs haven't been
  competitive in PvP since Year 1 of Destiny 2, you're prrrobably not
  missing on much.

  The only competitive AR archetype right now are the 600s (arguably the 720
  RPM Chroma Rush as well) so you're gambling on an eventual sandbox change for
  this to be more effective in PvP. 450s still feel "slow".
