overview: >
  Eyasluna is a 140 RPM Legendary Stasis Hand Cannon in the Kinetic slot. It's available from the final encounter in the Grasp of Avarice Dungeon, added to Destiny in December 2021. It was originally available, and much sought after, in Destiny 1 often referred to as a "mini Hawkmoon" not only because of the look but the name itself. "Luna"... well that's an exercise for the reader ðŸ˜‰

  It's a phenomenal weapon with multiple excellent perk pairings and readily available from farming the Grasp boss. I was able to obtain thirty rolls in the first week that it was available.

  With how much hype there is surrounding Eyasluna there's no shortage of (often-conflicting) content. This is a Good Thing(tm) because it means in this case, Bungie is doing a great job producing perks where, in spite of what many will tell you, there is no clear winning combo for all players and all play styles. There's two different perspectives I'd suggesting watching/listening to:

  * [Is Eyasluna's God Roll a Disappointment?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNU3qK04nSM) - Drewsky


  ...and a whole bunch of others that you can have on when you're driving or otherwise looking for background Destiny talk ðŸ™ƒ This list will undoubtedly grow over the coming weeks as people have a chance to get their hands on varying rolls for testing.

  The decision tree for me comes down to one thing: `Rangefinder`. `Rangefinder` increases the `Zoom` factor and if you're OK with that change in perspective, then you should strongly consider running `Rangefinder`. If you equip a roll with `Rangefinder` and find that it feels "off" then well, it's not for you and that's 100% OK. [If it doesn't feel good, don't do it!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMRbbeGuaF8). You're not missing out on a make-or-break experience for using Eyasluna. Even if `Rangefinder` feels great, but you want to do something different and give `Perpetual Motion` a shot? Well by all means!

  With `Headstone`, `Kill Clip`, `Demolitionist` and `Harmony`, Eyasluna has a terrific selection of fourth column perks for PvE. There isn't anything brand new / game-changing so not much to discuss here in the comments section. `Perpetual Motion` in the third column is the new perk, but I wouldn't reccomend it in PvP over nearly anything else in the column ðŸ™ƒ


  Aztecross [points out something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXdIx7d_p84&t=482s) worth considering: `Headstone` is what makes Eyasluna unique from a PvE perspective. Sure it can roll with good combos, but isn't Fatebringer w/`Explosive Rounds` and `Firefly` hard to beat? Or a Judgment with `Demolitionist` and `Adrenaline Junkie`? Or generating Warmind Cells with the Seventh Seraph Officer Revolver? Or an Adept Palindrome with `Subsistence` and `Rampage`? Run it for a reason, and that reason is `Headstone` since that's what makes it unique among 140s.
