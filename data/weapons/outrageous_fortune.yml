overview: >
  The Outrageous Fortune is a 150 RPM Grenade Launcher, originally released in
  Season 4. It was reissued in Season 11 with random rolls. Given where the
  perks ended up slotting out, it's probably the least desirable among the
  currently obtainable drops (Berenger's Memory, Interference VI, Love and
  Death etc.).
