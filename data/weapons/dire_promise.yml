overview: >
  The Dire Promise is a 140 RPM Hand Cannon that was re-issued all the way back
  in Season 10 and much has changed. Sunsetting was introduced and then rolled
  back, 150 RPM HCs were collapsed into the 140 RPM frames and 110 RPMs were
  upgraded to 120 RPM, turning them into absolute PvP monsters. 140s are middle-
  of-the-pack but still pack a decent punch.
