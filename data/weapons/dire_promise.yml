overview: >
  The Dire Promise is a 140 RPM Hand Cannon that was re-issued all the way back
  in Season 10 and much has changed. Sunsetting was introduced and then rolled
  back, 150 RPM HCs were collapsed into the 140 RPM frames and 110 RPMs were
  upgraded to 120 RPM, turning them into absolute PvP monsters. 140s are middle-
  of-the-pack but still pack a decent punch.

  Once upon a time 120s rules the roost and 140s needed a bit of help. Recently
  120s have had their wings clipped giving 140s some room to breathe.
  Unfortunately Dire Promise is still (largely) on the old perk pool. The roll
  we have below will absolutely the job done, but you likely have better options.

  Dire Promise is hampered in PvE by having only the old perk pool
  available. It's likely not your choice for high(er) tier PvE content
  because of that.
