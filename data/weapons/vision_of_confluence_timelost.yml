overview: >
  *This is the "Timelost" (or "Adept") version of this weapon, which drops only
  by completing the Conflux encounter Challenge in Vault of Glass on Master
  mode.*


  The rolls here are the same as the
  [normal version]({{< ref "/docs/vog/vision_of_confluence" >}} "normal version")
  except with a higher drop chance because the Timelost version comes with
  double perks in the final two columns.
