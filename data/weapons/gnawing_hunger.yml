overview: >
  Gnawing Hunger is a 600 RPM "Adaptive Frame" Energy Auto Rifle first
  introduced in Season 6. It has been reissued in Season 11, meaning it will be
  capable of going up to the Season 14 power level cap. Adaptives were buffed
  Season 10 and slightly nerfed afterwards, yet remain strong.

  using the generally agreed-upon "God roll" roll with `Tap the Trigger`,
  `Kill Clip` and a Stability Masterwork.


  * *"Is there a bug with this gun or is it just really good? I feel like I'm
  killing too fast right now... like a little bit too fast. I don't get it."*

  * *"This... it feels better than Summoner and SUROS. I can't believe there's
  a weapon like this in the game and I didn't know about it. I've never seen
  something like this."*

  * *"Dude what is this TTK? I don't get it! This TTK is a little too fast
  Bungie."*


  I hopped in to the Tribute Hall and ran several Recoil pattern tests
  with various Barrels, Magazines, Perks and Masterworks (Arrowhead, Steady
  Rounds, Tap the Trigger, etc.). At base Stability and Recoil (on console
  at least), it's pretty hard to control.


  There are two ways to get Gnawing Hunger to hone in for you:


  1. **Tap the Trigger**: The most noticeable difference in bullet
  concentration comes from TtT. If you want a laser beam, you want TtT. That
  being said, if you *only* get TtT and no other Stability or Recoil perks,
  it's not nearly as easy to control as it could be.

  2. **Arrowhead + Counterbalance**: This combo *absolutely works* as well.
  I was
  able to cluster rounds around small targets just fine, without TtT. If
  you don't get Zen Moment or Tap the Trigger in the third column, but you
  do get Arrowhead Brake in the first column, you might find it totally
  capable, especially if you're on PC.


  What you **really** want is to slam all these perks together for maximum
  Stability and minimal Recoil, and that's what we're going to break down
  below.


  For reference, there's a great
  [post about Zen Moment](https://www.reddit.com/r/CruciblePlaybook/comments/ge6rcd/zen_moment_does_something_testing_review_guide/),
  and ultimately why it's featured in these rolls.

  `Gnawing Hunger`'s final column is pretty much nothing but damage-boosting
  perks! They're from the old perk pool, so you can file this away under "oldie
  but goodie". I still regularly use mine (Minotaur shields anyone?) and it has
  over 5,700 kills on it.
