overview: >
  The Number is a 450 RPM Precision Frame, Arc Energy Auto Rifle, offered as a
  random roll beginning in Season 14. It initially appeared years ago in the
  "Faction Rallies" events as part of the Future War Cult weapon pool. It
  [compares closely](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=CUiiU9;Cc8zza;)
  to the Shadow Price, a Nightfall-only reward offerd in Season 13.

  450s haven't been great in PvP since the first year of Destiny 2. In S14
  they received a minor buff to precision damage though it doesn't appear
  to have made a dent in the overall PvP meta. It isn't that they're "bad"
  per se, it's that so many other weapons are so good. Well, with one of
  the worst body-shot TTKs in the game I think some folks might state that
  they are actually "bad" ðŸ¤·
        
        
  As 450s go, The
  Number is perhaps a bit more interesting because its base `Recoil` is
  `70` which means you have a number of options to 'fix' the Recoil to
  vertical. Archetype and Recoil aside, The Number doesn't have a whole lot
  of PvP perks to choose from so we won't have too many rolls here.

  450s (and ARs in general) are in a tough spot for PvE.

  this comprehensively: they have a confusing damage profile compared to
  other alternatives in that slot. If The Number were a kinetic, perhaps
  less so, but the Energy slot is so loaded with great weapons that it's
  hard to imagine this being your top choice in its current state. That
  being said, frame buffs are always a thing and 450s seem long overdue
  for one!
