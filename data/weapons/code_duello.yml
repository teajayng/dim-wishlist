  [a guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iQSmF67Exk)
  hitting on `Blast Radius` and `Cluster Bombs` configuration for PvP and
  PvE. Of course, this was before the change was made that moved more of
  the damage away from the clusters. That being said, the overall thrust
  of the video still holds for PvP. For PvE with the release of the new
  damage perks, `Cluster Bombs` is no longer your pick (see below).

  Code Duello has some terrific new perks for dishing out major damage in
  a flexible way, one of which is incredibly interesting for folks soloing
