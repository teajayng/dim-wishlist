overview: >
  Vision of Confluence is a 180 RPM Precision Frame Scout Rifle. It's
  [one of three](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=C95shF;D_MIu2;ClfhMg)
  180 RPMs currently available. It drops in the Vault of Glass from the first
  three encounters: Conflux, Oracles and the Templar. Once acquired, it will
  also drop from either of the two secret chests and can be acquired from the
  post-Atheon chest for `Spoils of Conquest` x 20.
  
  
  The "Timelost" (or "Adept") version of this weapon drops only by completing
  the Conflux encounter Challenge in Master mode. That weapon has a different
  serial number in Destiny's database and is registered in this wishlist
  separately.

  While I find a good Trustee roll A-tier, Scout Rifles in general aren't
  super meta at the moment and haven't been save for MIDA in D2Y1 (and
  whenever Momentum Control comes along). We can definitely string together a
  few decent rolls should you find yourself stoked to pop a Scout in Crucible
  or Gambit.

  In high(er) tier content (GMs, Raids, etc.) you often play less aggressively
  and a well-rolled Scout Rifle can help you with that. Vision features a
  handful of great damage perks in addition to `Firefly` and `Rewind Rounds`
  which roll only on weapons in Vault of Glass (as of S14 that is).
