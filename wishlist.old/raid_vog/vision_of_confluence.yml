overview: >
  Vision of Confluence is a 180 RPM Precision Frame Scout Rifle. It's
  [one of three](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=C95shF;D_MIu2;ClfhMg)
  180 RPMs currently available. It drops in the Vault of Glass from the first
  three encounters: Conflux, Oracles and the Templar. Once acquired, it will
  also drop from either of the two secret chests and can be acquired from the
  post-Atheon chest for x20 Spoils of Conquest.
  
  
  The "Timelost" (or "Adept") version of this weapon drops only by completing
  the Conflux encounter Challenge in Master mode. That weapon has a different
  serial number in Destiny's database and is registered in this wishlist
  separately.

      Occasionally (often?) in Destiny, the source of an item hints at its use.
      Being a raid weapon, Vision of Confluence can be excused for not having a
      wide array of PvP rolls to chase. Personally while I find a good Trustee
      roll A-tier, Scout Rifles in general aren't super meta at the moment and
      haven't been save for MIDA in D2Y1 (and whenever Momentum Control comes
      along).
