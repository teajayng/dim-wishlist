    summary: >
      The Seventh Seraph Carbine (SSC) is a 450 RPM "Precision Frame" Kinetic
      Auto Rifle. Let's start with a quick comparison to randomly-rolled 450s,
      over on
      [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=BdCxNP;mJ1-6;Bqp0Wx;Fju9i;DmTiv3).
      In general the 450s are fairly the same stat-wise, with a material
      deviation in Aim Assist for the SSC; easily addressable with an Aim Assist
      mod. 

      
      Should you pick one up for use in Season 10? In Season 10, 600 RPM
      "Adaptive Frame" Auto Rifles are the meta (e.g. SUROS Regime, Monte Carlo,
      Hard Light). There's no pressing reason to chase SSC rolls for PvP.
      

      I personally love ARs, so I played with a
      [zero-Recoil, high Stability](https://d2gunsmith.com/w/DY2Aqw8sOokyOvhv0Wv1Ehw9zBP2FwQRxW2Ig9KX1MIo3LEpW)
      roll for several Iron Banner games, with both Enhanced Targeting and
      Enhanced Unflinching. I immediately wanted to go back to using my Arc
      Logic with Moving Target and Tap the Trigger :) The SSC is definitely a
      bit slower than you'd prefer (as are all 450 RPMs, even the vaunted
      Uriel's Gift these days). 


      That being said, if you enjoy Destiny's National Pasttime of shredding
      supers in sixes, a Vorpal-rolled SSC could be for you! If you're a fan of
      ARs or even just the SSC itself, why not pick one up and vault it just in
      case the meta changes? Here are a few things to keep in mind:
      
      
      * The lower the RPM the higher the range, and falloff for a base range SSC
      starts ~30m which is quite far in-game; probably at the maximum range
      you'd choose to engage with an Auto Rifle anyway.

      * I'm passing on `Threat Detector` because at that engagement range of
      15m, you're going to feel like switching to your special weapon.

      * With a base `Recoil` of `74`, you're fine there. I shot a few magazines into
      a wall with `100` and the pattern was the same. Do not put on a
      `Counterbalance` mod or else you'll ruin the recoil pattern. 

      * I don't have any rolls featuring `Elemental Capacitor` because at some
      point you hit diminishing returns on all this `Stability`. I pivot around
      `Moving Target` because it's not something that many Auto Rifles can roll
      and it makes it far more lethal by directly addressing target acquisition.


      Here's a few rolls worth considering that you can put to work today!

          This is my pristine, picture-perfect Auto Rifle roll. There's less
          than a 0.1% chance you get this, so if you do please buy us both a
          lottery ticket.

          Slideshot is active for two seconds starting from the slide, so you
          really only have about one second to put it to use. Without it, this
          is still a phenomenal roll.

          Let's repeat the above set of rolls by widening the Barrel and
          Magazine options to anything that boosts `Stability`. We're also going
          to be removing `Slideshot`. It works for sure, but it's not worth
          holding us up from banking these rolls.

          Shredding supers in 6s is, we can all agree, Destiny's National
          Pastime. We're repeating the same set of relaxed rolls above, this
          time pivoting around Vorpal in the final column.

    summary: >
      For its base stats and perks, there isn't a whole lot of reason to
      consider the SSC for PvE. While it does feature Swashbuckler and Rampage,
      it doesn't combine it with a reload-boosting perk like Feeding Frenzy or
      Outlaw. Breakneck, the Gambit Pinnacle weapon with the unique perk
      `Onslaught` is also 450 RPM and recently received a buff in Season 10. It
      shreds in PvE and since it's a Legendary weapon, it can take the Season 10
      Artifact mods.

      Still, there's at least a couple of reasons why you might want to consider
      a SSC.

      1. It's a Seraph weapon! If you're running Warmind mods on your armor,
      Seraph weapons will spawn Warmind Cells.

      1. It can roll with `Fourth Time's the Charm` and `Vorpal` together, which
      activates on Champions and in the current Season 10, Auto Rifles can take
      Overload mods. In the future things will rotate back around to take
      Anti-Barrier too. The mag seems endless when dumping in to Champions and
      bosses; kinda cool :)

          This is designed for dumping rounds in to enemies in high(er) end PvE
          content. FTTC and Vorpal make the roll; without both you may as well
          use another Vorpal weapon. Based on the past two seasons, they won't
          be hard to come by :)

          Run-of-the-mill Auto-Rifle PvE slayer perk set here. If you like the
          look, feel and sound of the Carbine as I do, you'll do solid work with
          this roll.
