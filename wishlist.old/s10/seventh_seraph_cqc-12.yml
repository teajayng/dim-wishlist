    summary: >
      The CQC-12 is an 80 RPM "Lightweight Frame" shotgun in the energy slot.
      Through leveling the season pass, you unlock a chance for it to drop at
      the conclusion of Gambit, Crucible and Strike activities. You can't really
      "farm" it per se. The good news is that there's only four perks in the
      final two columns meaning it's not incredibly difficult to get the perks
      you might be interested in. See how it compares to other randomly-rolled
      80 RPMs over on 
      [light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=BslVBs;CEKlVP;Brud8B;DmKQYw).
      Statistically, they're
      all quite similar and like all shotguns, otherwise identical in barrels
      and magazines.

      
      Three reasons why the CQC is exciting for PvP:

      
      * Where the CQC-12 stands out from its kin is that it can roll with the
      vaunted Quickdraw + Snapshot pairing. No other 80 RPM shotgun can do this.
      Here's 
      [the list](https://www.light.gg/god-roll/?f=2,10\(Shotgun\),28:0\(706527188;957782887\))
      of shotguns that can. Perhaps as a drawback however, it cannot roll with
      Opening Shot or Moving Target.
      
      * It can roll with Vorpal which means it
      can two-shot any super in PvP. If you'd like a little footage of DFP
      slaying with Vorpal (and an otherwise) near perfect roll,
      [here you go](https://youtu.be/30b4t1XZdi0?t=110).

      * It looks and sounds *amazing*, and that's like 80% of the reason to use
      a weapon :)


      Our first couple of roll sets will be classic shotgun rolls and the third
      will feature Vorpal; currently the only shotgun that can roll it!

      This section will be straightforward :) All of our rolls are toing to be
      centered around Trench Barrel. It provides a 50% damage boost vs. Vorpal's
      15%. Trench Barrel takes a melee to activate, but with shotguns you have
      to be in melee range anyway, so you're good!


      This isn't a "run and gun" shotgun. There are no damage-boosting perks,
      like Swashbuckler or Rampage, you have Slideshot and Auto-Loading Holster
      but so do plenty of other shotguns.
