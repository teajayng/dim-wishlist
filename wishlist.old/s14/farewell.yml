      With the recent nerf to 120RPM HCs and Aggressive frame shotguns (well,
      all shotguns really), sidearms now have more of a chance to shine.
      Farewell has some of the amazing new perks on it. Have a look at

          Back in the Breachlight days, shutting down supers with a Vorpal-based
          roll was a fun gimmick. If we invest everything into `Range`, we can
          get ADS effectiveness from to 14.67m to 17.32m.
