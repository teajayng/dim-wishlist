    overview: >
      Gridskipper is a phenomenal PvP weapon and arguably the best weapon
      introduced in S14. Many folks have reviewed it; here are a handful of
      selections:

      > *The feel of this gun is so very Destiny... and so terribly
      well-balanced and is yet another reminder that Bungie is the best at fun
      gameplay, bar none.* -
      [Ascendant Nomad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya5a-uIbq7w)


      > *This is the best pulse rifle in the game. Better than Messenger, 100%.
      Time to do the new activity to get the god roll!* -
      [ZkMushroom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M8xjUzDRfU)


      > *This thing is an absolute laser beam. Terrific Aim Assist and a
      vertical recoil pattern. It ticks all the boxes for me.* - 
      [DFP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Y5XZrTjSxs)


      **Why no Frenzy?** Frenzy has steep activation requirements and has
      an immaterial impact on your TTKs.


      **Why so much Multikill Clip?** At x1, MKC drops your TTK from
      `7c2b/0.80s` to `7c0b/0.67s` and your body shot TTK from `1.40s` to a
      much more palatable `1.13s`.

          The two new third-column perks `Heating Up` and `Tunnel Vision` are
          brilliant on the Gridskipper. I'm partial to `Heating Up` but people
          love them both. The roll wouldn't otherwise be different so I'm
          combining them here.

          Nice little pairing of two perks that play off of each other's

          ADS and `Snapshot` increases ADS speed).

          On Pulse Rifles, `Firmly Planted` is an acquired taste. I loved it on
          my Jian 7 paired with `Rangefinder`; amazing laser beam on long(er)
          sight lines.
