    overview: >
      From a PvP perspective, slug shotguns come in two flavours:


      * High Handling + Low Aim Assist: `Sojourner's Tale`, `First In, Last Out`

      * Low Handling + High Aim Assist: `Blasphemer`, `Heritage`, `Bonechiller`

      
      If you love sniping Guardians with slug shotguns and wish you had a
      Legendary you could use in place of your

      then you're in luck! Sojourner's offers a solid baseline set of perks
      that any slug enthusiast will recognize, as well as some interesting

        overview: >
          Coolguy has a terrific
          [video breakdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iDuWqA5MQM)
          of Soujourner's Tale. It's the only weapon in the game that can roll
          with this combo of `Tunnel Vision` and `Killing Wind`, which both
          proc on reload. What was new to me was that the benefits proc **as
          soon as a single shell has been reloaded**. You don't have to wait
          for the full mag to finish!
