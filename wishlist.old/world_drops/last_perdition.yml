      A randomly-rolled 390RPM Adaptive Pulse Rifle; here we go! If you like
      Bygones in the primary slot, Last Perdition is right up your alley. It
      was brought back in Season of the Drifter with random rolls, and it
      unfortunately kept a pretty baseline set of perks. There's so much magic
      happening in the Energy slot now that we're so deep into Destiny 2 that
      we're going to have a pretty high bar for rolls here.
      

      Lots of resources for this one, including the
      [Destiny Massive Breakdowns](https://www.destinymassivebreakdowns.com/)
      [podcast](https://soundcloud.com/destinymassivebreakdowns).
      I'll be quoting (or paraphrasing if I couldn't keep up :) Kyt_Kucha and
      Mercules904 quite a bit in here.

      * Kyt: "Stability helps your Aim Assist cone recover more quickly. Recoil
      makes the bursts more linear but it's not the same thing as having more
      Stability."

      * Kyt: "Wouldn't go with a zoom factor of less than 3 because otherwise you
      feel recoil too much"

      * M904: "Accurized Rounds for +10 range, but maybe not if you picked a
      medium to high zoom scope (go for more Stability)"

      * M904: "Remember that Range has a linear effect and Zoom has a
      multiplicative effect. Rangefinder is 0.1x zoom - be careful of it because
      it may push you too far. Using it with +2x SPO-26 would be a good combo.
      If you don't roll Rangefinder but you do roll a higher zoom scope, you can
      ignore Rangefinder. If you only have short-zoom scopes, use Rangefinder."
      
      * CoolGuy's review: [Last Perdition 2.0 In Depth Review - Top Tier
      Pulse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6nVNWTEttc) is terrific. Long zoom
      scopes aren't recommended because of the increased incoming flinch while
      ADS and they also decrease Handling which can make the weapon feel more
      sluggish. `Zen Moment` is capped out at 66% of Base Stability, which is
      super high at 66, so we're going to prioritize that.


      For some general slaying footage, ZkMushroom loves his Last Perdition!
      Here he is on PC - 
      ["My Favorite Pulse Rifle"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jXTmYiHbWQ) -
      and earlier on console - ["Last Perdition is the Best Pulse Rifle in the 
      Game?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwucqcnyX-s). "I don't like laning
      with pulses. I know Blast Furnace and Bygones will be better there. I like
      being aggressive with my pulse and this is the perfect one."

          With `Moving Target` and `Zen Moment`, your weapon should only produce
          yellow numbers. We'd also be thrilled to get `Firmly Planted` here!

          `Firmly Planted` is criminally underrated. It's a difference in
          playstyle that you have to work at, but you will absolutely be
          rewarded. We'll be getting so much `Stability` from `Firmly Planted`
          that we can relax our requirement for `Zen Moment`.

          Similar to the set of rolls above, but we're narrowing our scopes
          to create a solid low-zoom pairing with `Rangefinder`.

    summary: >
      When Last Perdition was brought back with random rolls in the Season of
      the Drifter, it came back with the standard perk pool from Destiny 2 Year
      1. Not a ton of finesse here in the rolls we're looking for :)

          There are so many amazing PvE weapons in the energy slot and this perk
          set is so dated that even with this combo, you may choose to use
          something else :)
