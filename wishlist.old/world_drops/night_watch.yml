      Night Watch is a 200 RPM Scout Rifle that dropped during Season of the
      Drifter (S6). It has been re-issued in Season of Arrivals (S11) and is
      the only 200 RPM Scout Rifle in the game that is currently available.
      [CoolGuy's review (5/2019)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1KGJ7WU9es)
      remains a great source of info for Night Watch. It's a bit over a year
      old, but the sandbox hasn't changed materially around 200 RPM Scouts (for
      better or worse) or the perks he talks through.


      200 RPM Scouts (including the Night Watch) are far from meta. Even the
      strongest of the bunch (MIDA) you never see. The maps aren't really
      designed for Scouts, perhaps save for Rusted Lands? and 200 RPM Scouts
      struggle against the powerhouses like Jade Rabbit.

      
      And now the section where I feel like I have to justify not just picking
      Outlaw + Rampage/Kill Clip on every weapon in the game 😃


      * I am not suggesting Outlaw because the base `Reload` is already plenty
      fast. Outlaw isn't bad here per se, there's just not a strong reason to
      choose it.
      
      * Conversely, I am suggesting Rapid Hit because even though it was
      [changed in S11](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/49126),
      it's still a solid perk.

      * I am not suggesting Rampage because at x1 it does not alter the
      TTK (it does at x2).

      * Conversely, I am suggesting Multikill Clip because it does alter the
      TTK (3H1B > 3H0B).


      Similar to my thoughts on 180 RPM Hand Cannons, I do think Explosive
      Payload is very strong here. The explosions have no damage falloff and
      with the high rate of fire, it means your target is constantly flinched
      (almost annoying so). Here's a 
      [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0uI-KZnD70)
      from Drewsky demonstrating how High Caliber Rounds and Explosive Payload
      work.

      > "[Explosive Rounds] made the crosshairs jerk horizontally while rising
      and reaching its peak resulting in more irregular and disorienting
      flinch patterns [than High-Caliber Rounds]."


      This was the same basis of my suggestion for Explosive Payload on the
      Patron of Lost Causes back in Season of the Dawn (S9). I think it's
      similarly strong here, especially in sixes where you're likely to get
      additional assist points from Explosive Payload when people are clumped
      together.


      Because of the high RPM, I'm also going to suggest we shoot for as much
      `Stability` as we can get to increase the recovery of the Aim Assist
      cone between shots.
