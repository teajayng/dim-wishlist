    summary: >
      The Interference VI (IVI) is not a Season 11 re-issue, but it is one of
      small number of weapons in the World Drop Power Weapon loot pool. Grenade
      Launchers haven't been meta PvE DPS for some time, so why record
      wishlist rolls for this? A couple of reasons:
      
      
      * This reissued IVI can now roll Full Court. The only other GLs that can
      roll Full Court are `Doomsday` and `Love and Death`, both of which are
      capped at end of Season 11 (i.e. 1060PL). Full Court, at max range
      (> 50m) has a 25% damage increase. It's worth picking up!

      * The perk pool is really small, with only four possibilities in the
      final two columns, which slightly offsets the number of perks in the
      first and second columns.

      * While it's not a S11 re-issue (i.e. power cap of 1310 and not 1360), it
      will still be useful for the next two seaons, so if you get a decent roll
      then it will have some longevity to it.

      
      The Power weapon pool is so small that you're going to buried under
      mountains of these. Chances are without even trying you're going to get
      a pretty decent roll. Enjoy your New Monarchy Grenader Launcher! :)

          If the stars align, you'll get one that bumps Velocity as high as
          possible.

          These form the core of the roll. Without them, there isn't much
          reason to run the IVI 😀
