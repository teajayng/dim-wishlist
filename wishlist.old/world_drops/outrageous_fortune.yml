    summary: >
      The Outrageous Fortune Grenade Launcher is a Season 11 re-issue of
      it Season 4 counterpart. Grenade Launchers haven't been meta PvE DPS for
      some time, so why record wishlist rolls for this?
      
      
      It's one of the small number of Power weapons in the World
      Drop loot pool. You're going to buried under mountains of these by the
      end of S11. Chances are without even trying you're going to get
      a pretty decent roll. Enjoy your Outrageous Fortune Grenader Launcher! :)
