      [CoolGuy's review (8/2019)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQt0MDS9JY)
      is great source of info for the Black Scorpion, as well as the Massive 
      Breakdown Podcast [Ep. 148](https://soundcloud.com/destinymassivebreakdowns/episode-148-bygones-last-perdition-and-black-scorpion-4sr-breakdowns).
      There are seven perks in the final two columns (versus the usual four to
      six) and during Season 9, this weapon does not benefit from the Rank 92
      extra-final-column-perk bonus. That means these rolls are going to be
      super challenging to get, so we're going to relax a few constraints along
      the way.

      * Recoil is `60`, so using a Counterbalance mod to make it vertical is a
      slam dunk. Check out CoolGuy's video for a
      [before/after](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFQt0MDS9JY&t=400).
      
      * All these rolls will recommend Rampage in the final column because
      "Rampage x 1 will kill with four crits in 0.7s."

      * The base Range hits max damage at 68m which you're not going to find
      often on a PvP map, so we're OK with it. We don't want to harm the range,
      but this roll isn't dying for more range. Mercules904 - "The 2x zoom blows
      through your range requirements. I really just like this gun more with a
      heck of a lot of Stability."
      
      * Zen Moment? YES. Stability is where our focus will be. Zen Moment gives
      you a bump to your base Stability which you can see
      [here](https://youtu.be/uElV7xVFN6Q?t=280) and the base Stability is a
      terrific `54`, the highest among all Scout Rifles (?!).
      
      * No Outlaw? NOPE. The reload is already plenty fast and there's no DPS
      perk to play off of in column three. It's not bad, it's just not
      make-or-break.


      Check out [ZkMushroom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdnJWuiUF2k) and
      [nKuch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc87SDsCrIQ) to see the Black
      Scorpion in action. I was surprised to hear how much Mercules904 digs the
      Black Scorpion (it's the weapon he used to get Randy's).

        name: Mercules Collector's Edition
        overview: >
          Let's call this the "Mercules" roll, since listening
          to the podcast linked above informed its creation. All Stability, all
          day, with better Aim Assistance and mobility from `Moving Target`.
          Because of the quantity of perks in the final two columns, your chance
          of this roll is... slim.
