    summary: >
      This Timelines' Vertex is the randomly-rolled successor to the Future 
      War Cult version of the same name from days gone by. While it uses a
      reskinned version of the Erentil, it is unfortunately not also a High-
      Impact Frame. Fusions had a pretty nasty nerf in S11, discussed in
      [roll comments](#hollow-words---pvp) on the
      Hollow Words.
      
      
      Since it's an Adaptive Frame, you need 6/7 bolts to hit and if you want 
      to OHK it needs to be within 17m, which is pretty darn close and pretty
      darn difficult when you factor in opponent mobility. SMGs and sidearms
      are arguably more effective within this range because they give you more
      mobility options and can more readily be used against mobile opponents.
      Increasing the Range will not increase falloff for Fusions at the moment.
      
      
      I can only really reccomend this type of Fusion Rifle to aficionados.

          If you're able to OHK, terrific! If not, chances are you're at least
          breaking shields and with a quick swap to a primary, you
          have an interesting combo. Typically I would go for more Stability but
          you're getting all of that from Firmly Planted so we can opt for
          Range perks where we can.
