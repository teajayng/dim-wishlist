  The Number is a 450 RPM Precision Frame, Arc Energy Auto Rifle, offered as a
  random roll beginning in Season 14. It initially appeared years ago in the
  "Faction Rallies" events as part of the Future War Cult weapon pool. It
  [compares closely](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=CUiiU9;Cc8zza;)
  to the Shadow Price, a Nightfall-only reward offerd in Season 13.

    overview: >
      450s haven't been great in PvP since the first year of Destiny 2. In S14
      they received a minor buff to precision damage though it doesn't appear
      to have made a dent in the overall PvP meta. It isn't that they're "bad"
      per se, it's that so many other weapons are so good. Well, with one of
      the worst body-shot TTKs in the game I think some folks might state that
      they are actually "bad" 🤷
      
      
      As 450s go, The
      Number is perhaps a bit more interesting because its base `Recoil` is
      `70` which means you have a number of options to 'fix' the Recoil to
      vertical. Archetype and Recoil aside, The Number doesn't have a whole lot
      of PvP perks to choose from so we won't have too many rolls here.

          Mr. Fun Police himself nabbed an
          [absolutely phenomenal roll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LozV7KaCHs)
          which happens to be this one right here. Just getting a single kill and
          activating `Multikill Clip x 1` takes you from a `6h2b/0.93s` to a
          `6h0b/0.67s` TTK. This place nicely with an ability or two up with
          `Surplus`, to get those crispy reloads.

          Classic combo here. `Surplus` and `Wellspring` were introduced in the
          same season and compliment each other nicely. `Wellspring` takes some
          of the edge off the reluctance to use abilities when running with a
          `Surplus`-based primary.

      450s (and ARs in general) are in a tough spot for PvE.
      [Ehroar demonstrates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yeyr60J8K6A)
      this comprehensively: they have a confusing damage profile compared to
      other alternatives in that slot. If The Number were a kinetic, perhaps
      less so, but the Energy slot is so loaded with great weapons that it's
      hard to imagine this being your top choice in its current state. That
      being said, frame buffs are always a thing and 450s seem long overdue
      for one!

        overview: >
          PvE tends to be quite ability-heavy so `Surplus` might not be up
          that often but it's gravy when it is, helping you maximize the
          uptime of `One-for-All` and refreshing `Multikill Clip`.
