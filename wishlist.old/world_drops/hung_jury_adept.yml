    name: PvP
    overview: >
      Scout Rifles in PvP still aren't shining but there are some really
      interesting rolls here that you can bolster with insane Adept mods. For
      example, if you slot an `Adept Counterbalance` mod, you'll bring the
      `Recoil` to `100`. Unfortunately that hurts your effective Range taking
      you from 83.36m to 80.05m 🙃

    name: PvE
    overview: >
      As Hung Jury drops from an end-game PvE activity, its primary utility is
      in that arena. There are so many good perks in each column that you
      don't really need a wishlist to tell you that `Firefly` is legit, so here
      are a couple of interesting combos.
