    summary: >
      This Jian 7 is the randomly-rolled successor to the New Monarchy Pulse
      of the same name from days gone by. It's a 390RPM Adaptive Pulse Rifle
      which is mostly the same as the Last Perdition which also rolls in this
      slot. The most important difference is that the Jian's base recoil is
      `80` which means that with a Counterbalance mod, it will be effectively
      perfectly vertical at `95`. Contrast with the Last Perdition whose base
      Recoil is `63` (
      [detailed comparison](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=BFRn3C;LQhzo)
      on light.gg)


      It has notable perk placement differences; perks are mostly similar with
      some slotting variations. There are no Rampage-based perks here because
      it doesn't make it any easier to off enemies unless you're at x 2 which
      is too situational for a solid recommendation.


      Everything written in the thoughts for
      [Last Perdition](#last-perdition---pvp)
      holds here as well, so I won't repeat all of that.

          `Firmly Planted` is criminally underrated. It's a difference in
          playstyle that you have to work at, but you will absolutely be
          rewarded. This perk alone is why the Jian 7 and Last Perdition have
          become two of my most-used pulses.

          Similar to the set of rolls above, but we're narrowing our scopes
          to create a solid low-zoom pairing with `Rangefinder`.
