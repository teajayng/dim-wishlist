overview: >
  The Stochastic Variable is a 900 RPM SMG initially introduced as part of
  the Faction Rallies event and was part of the Future War Cult loot pool.
  It was reintroduced with random rolls in S14 and has access to some of the
  new perks introduced with Beyond Light, but none of the S14-specific new
  perks (e.g. `Danger Zone`).

  
  It seems to be universally panned in PvP and highly regarded in PvE, so
  only PvE rolls will be featured. With the introduction of the
  [Shayura's Wrath](https://d2gunsmith.com/w/3682803680)
  Trials of Osiris reward, it gets some stiff competition in the PvP SMG
  space.

    overview: >
      Stochastic Variable is a sleeper at the moment, but with a Warmind Cell
      nerf of sorts likely incoming, it's a great alternative to pick up once
      your Ikelos SMG becomes perhaps a bit less useful.

        overview: >
          But still great! While `Feeding Frenzy` is the winner in Column 3,
          `Ambitious Assassin` and `Surplus` will also put in work. This is
          the same roll as the above with those just two swapped in, in lieu
          of `Feeding Frenzy`.
