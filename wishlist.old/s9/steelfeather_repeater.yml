      CoolGuy does a [terrific breakdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anp5VBGfhmI)
      of Steelfeather and it doesn't have super high marks for PvP. The base
      Stability at `38` is abysmal, so for a decent PvP roll we're looking to
      correct that. If we fix Recoil, it mitigates such low Stability. A base
      Recoil of `57` means we're not going to be able to bring it under control
      unless we use Arrowhead Brake with a Counterbalance mod. From there on out,
      we're going for as much Stability as we can. Without Stability and Recoil
      mitigation, there's not a lot of reason to use this weapon, hence the small
      number of PvP rolls. If you want to see firsthand why Firmly Planted is so
      amazing, [check out this timestamp](https://youtu.be/anp5VBGfhmI?t=214) for
      PvE testing and [this timestamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anp5VBGfhmI&feature=youtu.be&t=689)
      for PvP. "I feel it's a decent weapon. I personally don't crown it anything
      beyond it's a fun AR to have in your rotation."

          We're looking to max Stability and Range after maxing recoil.
          The roll is built around `Arrowhead Brake` and `Firmly Planted`. Other
          sources of stability are gravy.

          Most of our stability will come from Firmly Planted so lets use the
          barrels and magazines to push out the range. 
        barrels: [Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Extended Barrel, Full Bore, Corkscrew Rifling]

      There are two long form Steelfeather reviews kicking around. CoolGuy does a
      [terrific breakdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anp5VBGfhmI) of the
      weapon overall with PvE and PvP thoughts. [Aztecross](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdhugEZT1C4)
      has one as well and per usual, has a bit more excited yelling :) Interestingly
      they both compare it to a "higher range SMG". They also both comment on its
      applicability (or lack of) to anything beyond slaying red-bar enemies. In
      Sundial for example, it runs out of steam. Oddly enough, Breachlight performs
      better in that role; go figure. "I feel it's a decent weapon. I personally
      don't crown it anything beyond it's a fun AR to have in your rotation."

          How can we keep DPS up as long as possible while preserving as much Range
          and Stability as possible?

          With artifacts all over the map, it's possible we get another Barrier mod
          that applies to Auto Rifles. This could be a fun one to bank.
