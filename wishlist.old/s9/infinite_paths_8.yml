      CoolGuy reviews IP8 for both PvP and PvE, which is where these rolls
      originate. He discusses the State of the Union with respect to these frames
      [timestamped here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZnUT63RgnE&t=1023)
      and it makes for super interesting listening. TL;DR - Of all the Pulse
      Rifle frames, the lightweights require you to be the most precise yet reward
      you with the second slowest TTK. They're the only ones he feels are not
      currently competitive. Given that they used to be the best frames in D1
      (remember Hawksaw?), file one away for a future date.

    rolls:
      - &ipmiddle
        name: (PvP) "CoolGuy's Middle Child" Collector's Edition
        desc: >
          In the video above, CoolGuy makes a strong case for some buffs to this
          "middle" archetype of Pulse Rifle. "On console, Zen Moment and Eye of
          the Storm are great but you're going to get more utility from Zen
          Moment." We'll add EotS in later as a fallback.
        barrels: [Chambered Compensator]

          We have so much Stability and accuracy from other perks, this is a
          terrific roll even without it.

          Same as the above with all Stability-enhancing barrels

      - &ipmags

          Same as the above with any Range or Stability-enhancing magazine.

          Another +10 Stability from the Masterwork would be terrific but if we
          get everything else, we're still in good shape.

        name: (PvP) "Middle Child" CE (Hurricane)
        desc: >
          EotS is our second choice; perhaps a bit less helpful than Zen, but
          still a beast.

          Sans Masterwork, still an interesting roll.

      Here we're featuring a few rolls from the CoolGuy [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZnUT63RgnE)
      mentioned above. I would put these pretty low on my list but if you're a
      fan of the aesthetic of the Osiris weapons, why not grab a few of these
      while they're still available? "It performs as expected. Great for mid-
      and low-tier adds. It does really well."


      These rolls are just north of 2% because of the number of perks in the
      final two columns `(0.16 * 0.16 = 0.02)`, and the fact that they don't
      benefit from the Season 9 Rank 92 bonus of an additional perk in the
      final column.
    rolls:
      - &ipdragon
        name: (PvE) Explosive Dragon 🐉
        desc: >
          This is the one of the few weapons in the game that can roll with
          Demolitionist + Dragonfly. Each enemy that dies to Dragonfly (don't
          forget Dragonfly Spec!) will count as an additional kill for
          Demolitionist.
        barrels: [Arrowhead Brake, Chambered Compensator, Corkscrew Rifling, Smallbore, Fluted Barrel, Extended Barrel, Hammer-Forged Rifling, Polygonal Rifling]
        magazines: [Tactical Mag, Appended Mag, Drop Mag, Alloy Magazine]
        perks1: [Demolitionist]
        perks2: [Dragonfly]

          Classic punching. Not sure why you'd be punching enemies with your
          Pulse Rifle equipped but I'm not the boss of you. 👊PUNCH AWAY!👊
        perks1: [Grave Robber]
        perks2: [Swashbuckler]
