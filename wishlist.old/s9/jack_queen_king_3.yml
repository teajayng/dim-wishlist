    summary: >
      This is going to blow your mind... but JQK3 and Waking Vigil (via Dreaming
      City) are the only two randomly rolled 150 RPM Hand Cannons and the only
      other Energy HCs apart from
      Luna's Howl (RIP Luna) and Not Forgotten. Its base stats are [among the
      best of all of these](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=JLYoE;JLYoH;T6w4n;Yf09u)
      with `96` AA (91+Sight) and `73` Handling! For analysis and gameplay,
      check out this [CammyCakes review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHIhi5fkxDw).
      One interesting bit that stood out: "The diffence between a max range JKQ3
      and medium range one is about half a meter". Yes for falloff that's true,
      but since Range affects stickyness, it's still got value here. For some of
      us (myself included), [CoolGuy's take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI5CjuOonRc)
      on the JKQ3 might be more up your alley, PvP-wise: "For Crucible it isn’t
      necessarily bad, but it’s kind of an acquired taste." It's never clicked
      with me but some people absolutely love it. IMHO similar to Sunshot - it's
      great on paper but the model is so chunky that it obscures where you're
      aiming when it kicks up. Its stiff competition and model/kick funkyness
      are why these rolls are so narrow. It needs a lot to compete with Luna's,
      Not Forgotten and Waking Vigil (which can be farmed from Menagerie with a
      predetermined Masterwork). The second set of these rolls is meant to be
      slightly more forgiving if you really want Demo and/or Snapshot.

          Be sure to let me know how many dieties you prayed to in order to get 
          this roll. I'd suggest also buying a lottery ticket post-haste. As much
          Stability and Handling as we can get.

          The first thing we're going to do is remove Demo from the list of
          required perks. The roll is top-tier without it.

          Same as above, but we're adding in Handling MW.

          Same as above, minus Snapshot. Snapshot is terrific but it doesn't
          make or break the roll.

          Let's reboot this set of rolls around all Stability-enhancing sights
          and magazines. 
        barrels: [Truesight HCS, Fastdraw HCS, Steadyhand HCS]

      [Ehroar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVXNkbyfBrQ):
      "I definitely think this will be one of the best hand cannons in PvE and
      probably PvP in the energy slot." In general we're sticking with Rampage so
      we can throw on Rampage Spec and ride it out. Sure Swashbuckler and 
      Surrounded + Surrounded Spec are awesome but it's a Hand Cannon and you're
      probably not punching enemies if you're trying to work in its effective
      range. Those perks work better on sidearms, SMGs and shotguns. CoolGuy
      has a [great set of rolls](https://youtu.be/XI5CjuOonRc?t=463) I'm
      incorporating here as well. "Very stout PvE hand cannon; top-tier."
    rolls:
      - &jqk3sparksflying
        name: (PvE) Sparks Flying (Super Picky)
        desc: >
          Both Demolitionist and Subistence will proc once for each Dragonfly
          explosion kill. Use in situations where you can one-shot enemies. Don't
          forget Dragonfly Spec! Per CoolGuy, this is a rarely available combo;
          pick it up.
        barrels: [Truesight HCS, Hitmark HCS, Fastdraw HCS, Steadyhand HCS]
        magazines: [High-Caliber Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Armor-Piercing Rounds, Light Mag]
        perks1: [Demolitionist, Subsistence]
        perks2: [Dragonfly]

          Same as the above with relaxed masterworks. Neither good nor
          bad enough to tank or make the roll.

          You'll almost never have to reload here, because getting kills with the
          sustained DPS perks will give you your grenade back and using your
          grenade will reload the magazine.
        perks1: [Demolitionist]
