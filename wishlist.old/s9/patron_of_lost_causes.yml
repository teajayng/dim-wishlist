      CoolGuy absolutely loves his Patron, and has a great [video review of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTcp4JQD1fI).
      Since this is a controller wishlist, these rolls are all about maxing
      Stability. All of these PvP rolls would be perfectly fine rolls in PvE
      as well.
    rolls:
      - &prapid
        name: (PvP/PvE) "Rapid Hitstability" 
        desc: >
          This is all about stability. Yes, Explosive Payload and Vorpal don't
          increase stability but they would make this already great roll even
          better.
        barrels: [Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling, Fluted Barrel, Chambered Compensator, Polygonal Rifling]
        magazines: [Tactical Mag, Accurized Rounds, Steady Rounds, Flared Magwell]
        perks1: [Rapid Hit]
        perks2: [Explosive Payload, Vorpal]
        masterworks: [Stability MW]

        name: (PvP/PvE) "Rapid Hitstability" (Minus Barrels)
        desc: >
          Same as the best, minus the barrels

      - &prapidrange
        name: (PvP/PvE) Rapid Rangestability
        desc: >
          Maybe even though you're on controller, you like your Stability with a
          side of Range? Listen, I'm not the boss of you. Range barrels are a
          great option with this roll as well, but I think, less desirable hence
          their place in the batting order.
        barrels: [Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling, Extended Barrel]
        magazines: [Tactical Mag, Accurized Rounds, Steady Rounds, Flared Magwell]
        perks1: [Rapid Hit]
