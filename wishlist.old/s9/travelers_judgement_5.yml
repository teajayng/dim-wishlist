      CoolGuy with another [phenomenal review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4HGIAZQdY4)!
      There isn't a bad sight and it has little to no recoil. It can roll with
      Disruption Break which works in PvP (?!) as well as a combo of Rapid Hit
      and Tap the Trigger, which is a rare combo. 
      Keep in mind TJ5 doesn't benefit from from the Season 9 R92 additional
      perk in the last slot, so these rolls are *tough* to get. Recently, True
      Vanguard [released a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QXBw6NFi08)
      and that reminded me to get a little more specific on the picky rolls.

          With an `84` base Stability and two Stability perks in the third and
          fourth columns, let's focus on increasing Range (not at the cost of
          Stability).

          Same as the above, minus the magazines. These magazines add very
          little Range, so we're not missing out on much.

          `Hip-Fire Grip` is totally reasonable here, especially if you're a
          bouncy Hunter or floofy Warlock.

          Huge props to CoolGuy for calling out that Disruption Break not only
          works in PvP but that the debuff works for your teammates.

          Whatever you do, depart Season 9 with at least this roll!

      These rolls are pulled from the CoolGuy [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4HGIAZQdY4)
      above. Disruption Break, who knew? CoolGuy makes a great point: we might
      see a "season of the sidearm" where artifact perks like Barrier can be
      applied to sidearms and since Barrier is a shield, Disruption Break will
      be great to pair with it. If you don't use Disruption Break, you're better
      off using another Energy weapon with damage-increasing perks.
    rolls:
      - &t5shield
        name: (PvE) Super Picky Shieldbreaker
        desc: >
          That could mean breaking Barriers with Disruption Break, and
          not many weapons can roll with that perk! We're adding ALH because
          to use Disruption Break you need to switch to your Kinetic weapon,
          which means ALH will proc and TJ5 will be reloaded and ready to go.

          Same as the above, minus barrel preference. Removing these leaves us
          with a still absolutely phenomenal roll.

          Same as the above, minus the masterwork. All of the TJ5 base stats are
          so good that any MW will be helpful.
