    summary: >
      More of a PvE sniper, so we aren't going to have much to lay down here for
      a great roll. If you're hungry for a PvP Energy sniper, you want the 
      Beloved (Menagerie), Apostate (Altar of Sorrows) or Twilight Oath
      (Dreaming City). CoolGuy: ["It's OK, nothing special."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGHNinCK3HI)
      Handling additions are appreciated because it's such a clunky weapon.
      I toyed with not even having rolls here but it's easy to farm and only
      here this season; why not grab a decent roll?

          Psions use Trophy Hunter - who knew? "Pulse Monitor"?! Yeah, there's
          only four perks in the third column and it's the only one applicable
          to PvP. The is the only randomly-rolled sniper in the game with Pulse
          Monitor. Everythig else is attempting to buff the Handling so it
          doesn't feel so sluggish.

          Same as the above, minus `Pulse Monitor` which really is not a big
          deal in the first place, but neat to have if you're burning through
          Fractaline for these rolls.

          Same as the above, with a more permissive set of barrels expanded to
          anything that doesn't reduce Handling.

      CoolGuy: ["One of the best solo snipers in the game."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGHNinCK3HI)
      "Solo" also means "playing solo with a random group" (i.e. not coordinated).
      Nearly a perfect sniper for Gambit, especially paired with Malfeasance.
      You'll note these rolls are pretty strict, and that's because there are
      so few perks in the final two columns. Handling is so, so low on this
      sniper that I think you absolutely want the +20-25 Handling from a combo
      of the barrel perk and Masterwork.

          That's a quote from CoolGuy's review :) Throw a `Backup Mag` mod on here
          to be able to do that.

          Yep it works great outside of Gambit, but even better within. Pair it
          with Malfeasance. Shoot shields, break them and it refills the mag. Then
          switch to Malfeasance (Kinetic with bonus Taken damage) and MELT.

          Heavyweight modifier? Never run out of ammo. Famine modifier? That rare
          Heavy brick is like finding a Special brick at the same time.
