    summary: >
      Rapid-fire frames in PvP are a different breed. They're not like
      Aggressive or Precision Frames for the spicy, consistent one-hit kills.
      If you want something like that in this slot, you want to farm Menagerie
      for
      [Dust Rock Blues](https://www.light.gg/db/items/636912560/dust-rock-blues/)
      or even
      [Toil and Trouble](https://www.light.gg/db/items/2957367743/toil-and-trouble/).


      The big debate here will be Opening Shot or Rampage. Many folks, like Sheikh
      (aka [Destiny Fun Police](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njEmXDccobw))
      prefer Rampage + Rampage Spec in the final slot. I don't and here's why:


      1. Rapid-fire frames require 12 pellets to kill. Each tier of Rampage
      decreases the number of pellets needed by one. Here's DFP going on a
      [killing spree](https://youtu.be/OSTDpEo7_D4?t=187) with Rampage x 2, the
      tier where you need 10 pellets to kill (i.e. a Dust Rock Blues pellet
      count). If you're going to two-tap basically no matter what, I'd rather
      have Opening Shot to increase the chance more of my pellets hit. Even
      DFP says, "Using a Rapid-Fire shotgun you're going to have to double-tap
      most people."

      2. I prefer to use Icarus Grip in my mod slot. That doesn't negate
      the power of Rampage in general but if you're not going to run Rampage
      Spec, that's even less of a reason to consider running Rampage.


      Based on the YouTube content creator hive mind, I'm in the minority on this
      opinion. It's easy to farm; be your own judge :)

          Alright, here's a spicy take. Firmly Planted works while sliding and
          increases Accuracy **specifically**, not indirectly via Range. We
          discussed Opening Shot above and how I value hitting more pellets all
          the time versus doing a negligible additional amount of damage
          when Rampage is active, some of the time. This is the first roll that
          [Aztecross](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGe3z2doHbQ)
          uses in his video review (among others). It cleans up!

      There's a good bit of [cargo-culting](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cargo_culting)
      when it comes to shotgun "God Rolls" and while I don't think there's any
      outright awful damage perks here, I do think you're better off with some
      than with others. [Aztecross](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGe3z2doHbQ)
      is a good balance of science and excitement in terms of roll knowledge, so
      check it out; he's one of the rare folks to see the value in the
      criminally underrated Firmly Planted on shotguns.
      

      There are a ton of damage-boosting perks on Perfect Paradox! We have
      Swashbuckler, One-Two Punch, Trench Barrel and Rampage. Let's go!
      
      * **One-Two Punch**: If you're going to be using One-Two, you're better off
      with a high(er) impact shotgun. Your flow is shoot-punch-punch-shoot-...
      and with a Rapid Fire frame, your "shoot" is doing very little damage,
      comparatively. The perk is solid, but not on this frame IMHO.

      * **Trench Barrel**: Post-Warmind, Trench Barrel took it on the chin. It was
      limited to a few seconds or three shots. Given that Bungie has never gone
      back on a nerf, feel free to pick one of these up for posterity but it's
      not all that great. It's kind of like the reverse One-Two Punch. Your flow
      is punch-shoot-shoot-shoot-punch-... so it's better for large(r) add clear
      but if you're dealing with larger adds/bosses you're getting stomped away
      so yeah, it's fine but not anyone's go-to at the moment.
      
      * **Rampage**: Solid! Not much to say here; same as it ever was. Throw a
      Rampage Spec mod on to extend the duration by 1s.
      
      * **Swashbuckler**: I prefer Swashbuckler here because it lasts as long as
      Rampage + Rampage Spec and you can shortcut the with a melee to Swash x 5.

          You really want a Trench Barrel roll don't you? Let's go with 
          Appended for a larger mag (presumably you're dyyying to throw a Boss
          or Major Spec mod on here) and Field Prep for faster reload when
          you're crouched in front of a boss/major.
