      CoolGuy's video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXwdAQGOfeY) is
      both PvE and PvP but focuses intensely on PvP. Some choice cuts: "I
      would try other rolls while I was reviewing this and I kept coming back to
      Vorpal." "Landing shots is more important than accuracy; shouldn't be
      worried about straight precision. More important to get the recoil
      straight up and down than it is to add stability because you have to
      control the stability after every burst anyway." I have to agree - Vorpal
      is pretty amazing in PvP and I did wish I had it several times. Without
      Vorpal, it's just another two-burst sidearm. You may as well use a
      Smuggler's Word with Tap the Trigger, which has one of the lowest TTKs in
      all of Destiny.
    rolls:

          This is my personal perfect PVP roll. Threat Detector has a far longer
          range than you'd think (beyond damage falloff) and Vorpal shreds through
          supers. The rest of this roll is all about maxing out the range.
        barrels: [Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling]
        magazines: [Accurized Rounds]
        perks1: [Threat Detector]

          With a Range Masterwork, you can make up for not having Accurized

          With Accurized, we're not as worried about the Range Masterwork.

          While Threat Detector is solid, missing it doesn't change how amazing
          this roll would otherwise be.

          Let's reboot by widening our acceptable barrels.

          Same as before, minus magazines. Still a phenomenal roll without any
          particular magazine.

          Same as before, minus Threat Detector since the roll is amazing
          without it.

      Ehroar focuses on Breachlight - ["This Sidearm Might Just Be The New Recluse"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrYRPglvMHY)
      "I truly believe this weapon is better than Recluse and I believe it will be
      the new meta for PvE." He mentions three amazing rolls (well four kinda)
      that I'll capture below. You won't see obviously good rolls here (e.g.
      Outlaw + MKC) because the combination is so straightforward and easy to
      roll. I.e. you don't need to come to a DIM wishlist to tell you that these
      perks pair well togther :)
    rolls:
      - &gunslinger
        name: (PvE) Picky Gunslinger
        desc: >
          Ehroar: "Great for basic add clear. Once you get MKC going you can
          shred Majors and Ultras." We're going for max range with some extra
          perks and a Masterwork, but those are just icing on this shredding
          cake. The lack of a Range Masterwork, or any specific Masterwork
          doesn't make or break this roll so I'm leaving it out.
        barrels: [Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Fluted Barrel, Polygonal Rifling, Corkscrew Rifling]
        magazines: [Tactical Mag, Accurized Rounds, Flared Magwell]
        perks1: [Outlaw]

          Once you get on a tear, the damage perks will recharge your grenade
          quickly and by throwing it, you'll reload the mag. Rinse and repeat.
          This is especially spicy when paired with Devour-lock.
        perks1: [Demolitionist]
        perks2: [Rampage, Multikill Clip]

          Pair with Devour-lock and Nezarac's sin and you'll be flush with health,
          grenades and ability energy.

          With a Major or Boss spec, Breachlight surprisingly wrecks. Throw this
          on in Sundial and watch what happens to Champions and Bosses.
