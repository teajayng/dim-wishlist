      Fallout has an interesting, [pro-Stability take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVVLwg1pVs4)
      on the Gallant. "This might be THE fusion rifle for controller players".
      It's bolt grouping isn't as tight, but you can get Recoil to 100 (with a
      Counterbalance mod). Go for Stability! With respect to the magazine, I
      prefer the unaltered charge time. There's not too many rolls here because
      it's not really worth running unless you get enough stat differentiation
      to make it more valuable than your dozens of alternatives in this crowded
      Energy slot.

          Bringing all of our stability and range tools to bear here. We want to
          first "fix" the recoil by getting it as close to ending in a `5` as we
          can. Then we go for Stability!

      CoolGuy has a [terrific PvE review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6BPg-W8z9g) of the Gallant.
      It has a PvP perspective but that part isn't as strong as Fallout's (IMHO,
      on this particular weapon). The important perks are your third and fourth
      column for these rolls, so really any of them are fine.

          falloff?
