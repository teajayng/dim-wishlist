    summary: >
      I absolutely love this new "Wave Frame" (i.e. Thermite Jr.) archetype!
      Our roll choices below might seem a little odd, but here we go. For
      PvP I want this always ready, loaded and moving quickly. That means I'm
      looking for Reload and Velocity in that order. The base
      Velocity @ `86` and Reload @ `77` (thanks to `High-Velocity Rounds` being
      one of two fixed barrels) seems more than good enough, so lets
      focus on Reload and Handling. I don't require Demolitionist because like
      Fighting Lion, I see Martyr's more as a starter than a finisher. By all
      means, roll with it, but I'm more excited about the perks below because
      I think we'll get more consistent utility from them.
      With breach-load launchers, we're going to run `Quick Access Sling`,
      which buffs swapping speed and since the Martyr's Handling stat is
      already so high, I don't think we need too much more Handling here.
      Let's look for Velocity-based barrels and since there's only two
      available magazines, that choice is easy ;)

          Elemental Capacitor's +Reload and +Handling buffs (Solar and Arc
          respectively) are pheneomenal attributes to bump on breach load
          launchers.

          Same as above, minus Elemental Capacitor. It helps but it's totally
          optional.

      This is one of my favourite weapons in all of Destiny! Pretty much any roll
      is fine but if you want to push your roll criteria, here we go.

          Martyr's absolutely shreds shields and a shieldsplosion roll like this
          will be super fun. Those hopefully chained kills should keep your grenade
          rolling from Demolitionist and upon activating it will reload your weapon
          and so on...

          We're doing everything we can to reload as quickly as possible with this
          roll. How do we keep one in the chamber constantly?
