      [Dark Drinker 2.0](https://youtu.be/W_ObIqaGhvM?t=305)
      is... sorry I mean Falling Guillotine... is a new "Vortex Frame" sword
      in S11. It does a
      [ridiculous](https://youtu.be/DxlrZnH7C1g?t=344) - 
      [amount](https://youtu.be/hWzifDFNww0?t=30) - 
      of - 
      [damage](https://youtu.be/SbBOCOJpMaE?t=103)
      and is also just
      [weird](https://youtu.be/YRcZ9IglcZM?t=31).


      What makes this even better is that as with all other swords, the perk
      pool is super small, and with the Recaster perk `Umbral Enhancement III`,
      all of your Focused Umbral weapons get an additional final-column perk.
      As of this writing it appears to be bugged and I'm getting an extra final
      perk on unfocused drops 🤷‍♂️ (but also bugged in that I'm not getting a
      second perk on Cold Denial or Falling Guillotine 🤪) Chances are you'll
      get the roll you're after relatively quickly? When you do, rejoice! That
      roll will keep you all the way through Season 14.


      We're going for the classics here: Whirlwind and Surrounded. Maybe you'll
      get insanely lucky and get both Whirlwind and Surrounded as the perks in
      the final column?


      *Note that swords only have one possible Masterwork (Impact) hence the
      appearance of "any MW will do" in the wishlist; which isn't really the
      case*

          With Whirlwind and Relentless you'll be slicing for what seems like
          forever. C/o
          [this analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/a2mjez/sword_awareness_1_jagged_edge_vs_honed_edge/),
          Jagged Edge is the clear choice for the first column, but you'll want
          to make sure your reserves are increased in armor. Heavy Guard
          sacrifices Charge Rate and massive increased all the other important
          sword stats, but that's fine because Charge Rate is such a compressed
          stat you won't notice the difference.

          With Surrounded up, you'll be mowing through hordes of adds in no
          time.
