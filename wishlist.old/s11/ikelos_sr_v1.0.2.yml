    summary: >
      The IKELOS_SR_V1.0.2 is a 140 RPM Rapid-Fire Frame sniper. Stat-wise, the
      currently available batch are
      [mostly the same](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=BKsJdr;o8g0X;DN5NWh;BLxysY)
      and unfortunately none can roll with both `Snapshot` and `Quickdraw` 😱
      Note that the IKELOS does have a slightly higher Zoom (40 > 45) than half
      of the bunch. This may or may not work with your playstyle.


      Let's get this out of the way - "What roll will replace my Beloved?"
      Unfortunately none of them. No 140 RPM sniper beyond the S11 power cap
      can roll like Beloved, Tatara Gaze, Apostate, etc. It looks like they're
      almost purposefully decoupling the great perks we're used to seeing
      together: Snapshot + Quickdraw, Snapshot + Opening Shot, etc.


      Some thoughts on the perks I've selected:
      
      
      * I value `Moving Target` over `No Distractions` for a few reasons.
      Contrary to the name, `Moving Target` procs
      [whether or not you're moving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcpJWC039m8).
      `No Distractions` takes 1.5-2s to activate. That is an eternity and
      basically unusable in Comp or Trials. Even when it does activate, `No
      Distractions` doesn't reduce flinch by that much. Here, check out
      [Fallout's testing](https://youtu.be/cUE4W03qPVY?t=171).

      * `Seraph Rounds`, has just about every hidden benefit you can imagine
      ascribed to it. The only one I'm able to find definitive evidence for
      is that it increases range falloff by about 2m. When I compared it with
      `Accurized Rounds` on the IKELOS SMG, it pushed it about 1m further.
      That's the only reason I prefer it here, but they're basically the same
      in that one aspect. IMHO Bungie could definitely stand to redefine this
      perk if they're planning on keeping IKELOS weapons around.


      There aren't a ton of great perks here, so I'm only featuring one roll
      with two variations: favouring `Handling` and favouring `Range`.

          The IKELOS has `73` Aim Assist and with `Moving Target`, a `Targeting
          Adjuster` mod and `Enhanced Sniper Targeting` on your helm, you're
          plenty good on AA. Whatever tiny part of the `Range` stat affects
          AA is outweighed by faster Handling contributing to faster ADS and
          faster stow speed for cleanups.

          The 140s tend to have quite high `Handling`. If you're solid with the
          base level of `Handling` maybe you prefer all-out `Range`? Let's keep
          the same set of rolls above and swap in`Range`-boosters. Some of the
          rolls overlap, so there will be fewer rolls here as they will be
          'caught' by the above set of rolls.

      Ehroar and Kackis both review the IKELOS 1.0.2 and land on similar
      reccomendations which I'll capture here. Ehroar's take is a little more
      thorough so I'm expanding the Collector's Edition with his thoughts.

      * [Ikelos Sniper is Back! What is the God Roll?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waOR-IuhIIc) - Ehroar

      * [The Sniper Meta is BACK!? - Best New PvE Sniper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQSfa96KoO4) - Kackis

      
      The core perks are fine, so even though the Baseline is pretty easily
      obtainable, don't let that dissuade you; it's solid!
