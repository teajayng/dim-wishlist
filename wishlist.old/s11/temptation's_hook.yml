    summary: >
      Temptation's Hook is an absolutely EN FUEGO Season 11 sword that has all
      the perks you'd have to get separately from Honor's Edge, Steel Sybil,
      Stryker's Sure-Hand, etc. It's got Surrounded, Flash Counter, Whirlwind
      Blade... AND VORPAL WEAPON folks!


      What makes this even better is that as with all other swords, the perk
      pool is super small, and with the Recaster perk `Umbral Enhancement III`,
      all of your Focused Umbral weapons get an additional final-column perk.
      As of this writing it appears to be bugged and I'm getting an extra final
      perk on unfocused drops 🤷‍♂️ (but also bugged in that I'm not getting a
      second perk on Cold Denial or Falling Guillotine 🤪)


      * "Why no roll w/`Whirlwind`?" If you're going up against hordes of adds,
      you'll benefit best from Surrounded (see below). If you want to whack on
      a single target, then this sword isn't the choice; you want Falling
      Guillotine instead.

      * `Surrounded` + `Surrounded Spec` ends up giving you a massive 36%
      damage increase ("only" 25% w/out Spec) and since a Sword is in-your-face
      there's a high chance you'll proc this regularly. Classically great perk
      on swords.

      * `Flash Counter` not only disorients but 
      [applies a 20% debuff](https://youtu.be/b9HcFqLdlyQ?t=1477)!
      This means *all incoming damange* is upped by 20%. You can imagine how
      helpful this would be in Public Events (like the S11 Contact event), to
      debuff the boss with up to eleven other Guardians attacking. The debuff
      lasts for five seconds, so you'll need to periodically switch to blocking
      for this to take effect. Given that every boss in the game stomps, this
      is a great way to take out your anti-stomp rage 😡



      Fortunately the perk set is very small and chances are you'll get the
      roll you're after relatively quickly? When you do, rejoice! That roll
      will keep you all the way through Season 14.


      *Note that swords only have one possible Masterwork (Impact) hence the
      appearance of "any MW will do" in the wishlist; which isn't really the
      case*

          Vorpal is a solid tool to have here. This roll won't do the most
          single-target damage against bosses, but that's not why you have it;
          you have it for the utility it brings. Being able to slice through
          adds **and** throw a heavy attack at a Champion or Boss is 😙

          Jagged Edge is the clear choice for the first column, but you'll want
          to make sure your reserves are increased in armor. Heavy Guard
          sacrifices Charge Rate and massive increased all the other important
          sword stats, but that's fine because Charge Rate is such a compressed
          stat you won't notice the difference.

          Same as the CE, minus Heavy Guard. That's OK because you won't be
          doing all that much defending while slicing away with your sword.

          With Surrounded up, you'll be mowing through hordes of adds in no
          time.

          `Flash Counter` is akin to parrying in many games, where a perfectly
          timed block will stagger your attacker. Same set of rolls as above,
          but with `Flash Counter` in the final column.

          Baseline `Guard Efficiency` is pretty awful, but if you're able to
          time it right, you won't have to keep it up for long so maybe you're
          OK with it?
