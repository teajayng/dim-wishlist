    summary: >
      Cold Denial is a 340 RPM "High-Impact Frame" Kinetic Pulse Rifle
      introduced in Season 11. See
      [how it compares](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=BIfK-Z;C-tvt8;BFN60K;MZyyP)
      to the existing High-Impacts. The major difference might seem like a minor
      one, but check out the `Zoom:14` compared to the others with `Zoom:18`.
      The lower zoom means you've got a wider FOV while zoomed in, and that
      small(er) thumbstick movements don't kick your reticle as much. It makes
      way more of a difference than it might seem like on paper.


      Everyone is covering this Pulse Rifle because it's absolutely amazing.

      and
      [Aztecross](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1jKsnDD6Ss)
      and I'm sure you'll see more coverage in the coming weeks as more folks
      get their hands on various rolls.


      The headline perk here is `Killing Wind`. The decent Stability and low
      Zoom factor downplay the need for the only other alternative:
      `Zen Moment`. Check out CoolGuy's review of
      [Killing Wind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go1TYsXCopc&feature=youtu.be&t=420)
      Here's are the benefits as he describes them:


      * `Killing Wind` has a five second duration. Additional kills refresh the
      duration.
      
      * It adds roughly five tiers of Mobility with the attendant benefits
      (strafe speed, etc.).
      
      * It adds roughly a 4m increase in damage falloff.
            
      * The Range boost it provides "is like a sustained version of `Opening
      Shot`".
         
      * Handling increase is on par with Snapshot and vastly improved stow
      speed.


      The last column is interesting. A handful of perks elevate the roll but
      in my opinion, none are essential. Headseeker might seem strange but
      with the High-Impact buff in S11, it means a 4H2B kill instead of 5H2B on
      6 resilience or less. Think about it as making your initial engagement 
      more forgiving whereas Multikill Clip and Swashbuckler make your follow-on
      engagements more forgiving.

          You have to see Cold Denial with 100 `Recoil` and bumped up Stability
          to believe it. It will require that you use a Counterbalance mod,
          which is par for the course on Scattershot weapons (Autos, SMGs,
          etc.). It's completely vertical and barely moves during the burst.
          This roll even without the Stability MW, felt broken when I used it;
          really nuts.

          With all this Stability, this is a phenomenal roll. Zen Moment would
          be your next best bet to Killing Wind in column three, but Cold Denial
          has so much Stability that I don't think having Zen Moment makes or
          breaks it.

    summary: >
      There's not much to puzzle out here. In PvE you're going for as much
      `Range` as you can get with sustained damage upkeep. I think `Unrelenting`
      is a super interesting perk, I would just prefer to have the large damage
      bonuses active from damage-boosting perks.
