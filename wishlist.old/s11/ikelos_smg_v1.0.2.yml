  The IKELOS SMG 1.0.2 is an Aggressive Frame, Energy-slot 750 RPM SMG. With
  the advent of Warmind Cell mods, it has become a PvE staple.

    overview: >
      Back during the
      Warmind times (Season 3) its statically-rolled predecessor was a
      seriously legit part of the PvP meta. Apart from the original IKELOS SMG,
      in the history of Destiny 2, this archetype has had an unfortunate time
      of things. The only
      [other Aggressive Frames](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=CEeZUk;BZzrdV;GStUF;)
      have punishingly, unusably poor `Stability` so they never saw any
      play, not even on the fringes of the meta.


      A few weeks into Season 11 an Bungie drops the new version of the IKELOS
      SMG, now called the IKELOS_SMG_V1.0.2 (compared to S3's V1.0.1). It now
      features random rolls with the new Y3 perks like Vorpal Weapon and
      Demolitionist. It also has a tremendous amount of Stability compared to
      its brethren, about triple.


      * **`Seraph Rounds`**: The streamer~youtuberati are all abuzz about this
      perk. It has HCR built-in and does increased flinch! It increases
      Stability! It increases Range! One of those
      is correct - it does give a boost to damage falloff range. When I
      tested `Seraph Rounds` in the Tribute Hall, it pushed the range out by
      ~1m. Yep, a whole one meter. When I swapped in Accurized Rounds, it was
      basically the same, with a difference of less than a meter. I wouldn't 
      lose sleep about missing out on `Seraph Rounds`. Since this is a console
      wishlist and these Aggressive Frame SMGs have huge kick, we're going to
      prefer `Steady Rounds` and the attendant 38% increase in `Stability`.
      
      * **`Threat Detector`**: The only evidence I've been able to find of how
      this perk works is present in this video:
      ["Threat Detector In Depth"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EB7Fgvgchq8)
      which deduces a massive +20 to Stability at TDx1. The range for TDx1 is
      14.8M (and below of course) which means a laser-like boost to Stability
      to where you could practically hip-fire the darn thing (no it does not
      drop with Hip-Fire Grip in its perk pool :)

      
      Which set of rolls you go for depends on whether or not you want to keep
      your mod slot open for `Icarus Grip` or `Freehand Grip`. If you don't
      care for either of those, that's going to free up your choice of Barrels
      and you'll be able to throw a `Counterbalance Stock` mod in to fix the
      recoil.

        overview: >
          Any time you see Dynamic Sway and Tap the Trigger available in both
          columns, that's a tough one to pass up. TtT keeps you steady on the
          initial burst and DSR keeps you steady afterwards. After that it's
          all `Stability`. This roll would push Stability from 39 to 74 (?!) and
          that's not including the additional Stability from DSR and TtT! With a
          Recoil-fixing Barrel, the mod slot is free for you.

      Ehroar thinks the IKELOS_SMG_V1.0.2 might be the
      [best PvE primary in Destiny 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sgVvsCK2BM)
      mostly because it can generate Warmind Cells and it has a great perk
      pool. He makes a strong case and with Reach, the nukes are nukey.
      
      
      Note that the IKELOS_SMG also has `Disruption Break` will will proc when
      breaking a Barrier Champion's shield. However no other perks play off of
      it, so I won't feature a set of rolls here for it. Same goes for
      `Demolitionist` which is a great perk but doesn't overtly synergize with
      any of the other perks. As Ehroar points out, `Subsistence` wrecks the
      reserves on the IKELOS, by a whopping 44% (!) so I'm not recommending it
      as a perk.

        overview:
          Pair this roll with a `Surrounded Spec` mod and you are positively
          shredding through adds. Throw on a single Warmind Cell mod on to your
          armor and you become a nuclear bomb generating Guardian.
