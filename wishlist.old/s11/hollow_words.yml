    summary: >
      Hollow Words is a "Precision Frame" 740ms-charge-time Fusion Rifle
      released in Season 11. That means it shoots seven bolts and you need five
      of those to connect for a OHK.

      Fusions have been my favourite special since Destiny 1. I have an Erentil
      with 1,082 kills on it ðŸ˜±Currently fusions are not in a good place in the
      sandbox after a sweeping nerf that just went in. If you want the complete
      story, check out
      [CoolGuy's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYhJU9NN_iU).
      TL;DW: Range is
      [compressed](https://youtu.be/CYhJU9NN_iU?t=350),
      perhaps moreso than hand cannons were. The end result is steep falloff
      after 17m for all types, quickly pushing you out of reasonable OHK range.
      
      
      With the effect of bumping Range so negligible, you're only left with
      Stability and Handling to focus on. Higher Stability will result in less
      bolt spread as the burst completes, which is why we're going to focus on
      it. 


      So why are we here? Why even bother with PvP rolls of a Precision
      Frame when only High-Impacts are worth pursuing? Two reasons: `Killing
      Wind` and `Disruption Break`. Combined, you've got great benefits.

      * **If you get a final blow** then `Killing Wind` procs and you can begin
      [mapping Guardians](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qfhrTicLbU)
      at Erentil-like ranges with your Hollow Words.
      
      * **If you only break their shields** then `Disruption Break` activates
      and you can quickly swap to your primary and finish them off.


      Without both of these perks, you may as well run a High-Impact Frame. I
      think it's possible to have Killing Wind and a bunch of Range perks, but
      you don't need a wishlist to tell you to take a single perk ;)

          Let's bring in as much Stability as we can paired with our two
          superstar perks. I'm also willing to forego Stability in the barrel
          if it means having completely vertical recoil w/Arrowhead.

          With just these baseline perks, they still work great together, but
          you might miss out on some of the great Stability possible on this
          roll.
