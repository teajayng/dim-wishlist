    summary: >
      Season 11 is the first time we've seen Berenger's Memory since Destiny 2
      Year 1 (i.e. Season 1). It's the first time it's been available with
      random rolls. Grenade Launchers haven't been meta PvE DPS for some time,
      so why record wishlist rolls for this?
      
      
      It's part of the Umbral Engram pool, and part of a focused roll with the
      IKELOS Sniper, so you're likely to be swimming in these just by doing the
      weekly evac quests by the end of S11. Chances are without even trying
      you're going to get a pretty decent roll.

          If you want a GL for sticking 'nades on a boss, this is the roll for
          you. All GLs are basically the same these days, so this set of rolls
          applies for Outrageous Fortune, Swarm of the Raven, etc.
