  Remember when we all thought Wish-Ender would break the Crucible because
  you could see through walls? That's the last time I thought bows might
  break the sandbox, or really even ever thought about using bows in PvP
  at all. Did you even know you can see through walls with Wish-Ender? I
  digress...


  Many months ago, I saved a post by
  [/u/TheGuiltySpark117](https://www.reddit.com/user/TheGuiltySpark117) in
  the off chance I ever wanted to give bows a real shot in PvP. Over that
  time I've read and re-read it, every time I'm trying to figure out if I
  have a good bow roll. *I strongy suggest you check this out; it's
  phenomenal!*

    overview: >
      > You might’ve noticed that these aren’t specialized to the two types of
      playstyles I mention in my post. I did this on purpose because there are a
      much larger amount of players who aren’t bow mains, and care less about
      that kind of thing. These two are the best generalized god rolls that are
      tailored to the perspective of the majority. Both loadouts, however, are
      something that even I as a bow main in the crucible would be interested in
      acquiring.


      > There are two versions of this bow that I would consider a god roll
      depending on two different play styles: one being `Aggressive`, and the
      other being more `Reserved`.

        overview: >
          Here's a breakdown of what we're going for:
          

            * `Elastic String`: Sacrifices accuracy to increase draw speed,
              meaning you can pull it back and fire it faster. Aka, lowers ttk
              for the weapon by a small fraction. With this loadout we're not
              too concerned about accuracy as engagements will be at closer
              ranges.
            * `Fiberglass Arrow Shaft`: Lowers stability, which is not
              concerning for a bow, but increases accuracy considerably. This is
              the best type of arrow any bow can have because there are no
              noticeable drawbacks of having it.
            * `Killing Wind`: Adds five tiers of movement speed to your guardian
              when the trait is active, meaning you will feel much quicker and
              lighter, allowing you to play more aggressively.
            * `Unrelenting`: Rewards an aggressive playstyle by granting a small
              amount of health on top of triggering health regeneration. In the
              Crucible, every other guardian kill will trigger this trait.
              Triggering this trait means you'll have less downtime between
              engagements, and you'll have some room to perform interesting
              plays in 1v2/3 or more scenarios.
            * `Accuracy Masterwork`: This helps conteract the reduction in
              accuracy that Elastic string has, making the bow feel a little
              more reliable when shooting.

          The objective of this loadout is to max it's Accuracy as high as it
          can go, so that the player can use it at longer distances and not feel
          forced to engage at closer ranges.

            * `High Tension String`: We're going for max accuracy with this
              loadout.
            * `Fiberglass Arrow Shaft`: Again, the best Arrow type for any bow.
            * `Archer's Tempo`: High Tension String gives an increase to draw
              speed, and Archer's Tempo will act to negate its effects while
              still lowering Draw Time to a reasonable degree.
            * `Opening Shot`: Further increases Accuracy and bullet magnetism to
              the head, making the bow more reliable at longer distances.
            * `Accuracy Masterwork`: Again, going for as high of an Accuracy
              stat as we can.

            barrels: [High Tension String]
