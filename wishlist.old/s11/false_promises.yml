overview: >
  False Promises is a 360 RPM Kinetic Auto Rifle introduced in Season 11.
  The High-Impacts are notable by their extremely long `Range` and extremely
  poor `Stability` and False Promises is no exception. On console, False
  Promises is pretty tough to control. Even with vertical `Recoil`, there's
  still a lot of bounce in the reticle because the `Stability` is so low.

    overview: >
      I'm recommending, nay requiring `Dynamic Sway Reduction` for any False
      Promises roll I'd consider using in PvP, because of its marked affect on
      `Stability` and `Accuracy`. Here's what
      [Bungie had to say](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/49126)
      about DSR prior to S11:
      

      > **Dynamic Sway Reduction**: Adds 10 Stability over time in addition to accuracy (this is way more powerful than it sounds).
      Reduced reticle movement from Stability should now tell players this is working.


      Here's a couple of videos examining Stability, including the effects of
      DSR. These were recorded before the aforementioned buff, so some of these
      may be a little out of date depending on which part of the content you're
      referring to.

      All of the following rolls feature Eye of the Storm, Rampage and
      Swashbuckler. Think about this from a "forgiveness" perspective. If you
      want more forgiveness during your first exchange, choose Eye of the Storm.
      If you want more foregiveness during follow-on encounters, choose Rampage
      or Swashbuckler.


      **Closing Remarks**: S11 continues the S10 600 RPM Auto Rifle meta. If
      you're planning on using an AR, I'd suggest any of the 600s kicking
      around, notably the Gnawing Hunger since it's so easily farmable via the
      Recaster. Alternatively, wait until The Summoner is up as the three-win
      reward in Trials and grab on there. As far as False Promises is concerned,
      I'll be holding on to a good PvP roll in the hopes that the sandbox is
      updated in S12 or beyond.

        name: Stormfront 
        overview: >
          These 360s are primarily hampered by their ultra-low Stability, so
          we're going to do everything we can to correct it. `EotS` is part of
          that as it hones in progressively more as your health gets low. Be
          sure to swap in Counterbalance mod push the `Recoil` to `100`.

    name: PvE
    overview: >
      In PvE you're going for as much
      `Range` as you can get with sustained damage upkeep. I think `Unrelenting`
      is a super interesting perk, I would just prefer to have the large damage
      bonuses active from damage-boosting perks.
