    summary: >
      "First In, Last Out" was released for the first time in Season 11 since
      its initial drop at the launch of Destiny 2 - Season 1! It's the first
      time we've seen this with random rolls, so it does have a contemporary
      set of perks available (e.g. Demoiltionist and Vorpal). Once the
      gear-pocalypse hits after Season 11 and everything is sunset, it will be
      the only slug shotgun in the game apart from Chaperone.


      All that being said, it's a solid weapon with some solid rolls. Absolutely
      down the fairway for the sandbox and shotguns - grab some range and
      accuracy perks and you'll be all set. Slug shotguns have always been an
      acquired taste and nothing about filo changes that. It's not amazing, it's
      not terrible; it can do great work in the right hands.

          To quote my friend Lenny, "This is the kind of stupid idea I am fond
          of."
          [Aztec's contention](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj1tNWkP9Fg)
          is that slug shotguns struggle because of
          high enemy mobility combined with having to zoom means a much tighter
          field of view that makes them even harder to track. This is precisely
          why I stop using Chaperone around 4000 Glory in Comp. Hunters with
          high mobility (the stat and the skill to do so) and charging shotgun
          rushers become nearly impossible to hit (for me at least!). This is a
          series of rolls based around Hip-Fire Grip and Opening Shot. It's a
          totally different way of playing and I love the idea of it! I doubt
          it will become meta, but this list is all about fun, specific rolls so
          here you go 😃

          I'm unsure if the `Range` you're giving up here would tank the roll,
          but if you want the two most important perks to play around with, this
          is the stuff.

          `Range`- and `Accuracy`-boosting perks surrounded by Range-boosters
          in all the other columns. `Assault Mag` is also amazing in the second
          column when you're getting so much additional `Range` everywhere else!

    name: PvE
    summary: >
      In the 5/21/2020 TWAB, Bungie announced a surprising buff to slug
      shotguns:

      > Slug Shotguns are underused in PvE, because they require crits to
      maximize damage, and didn’t reward that precision with higher damage
      per second: `Slug Shotgun PvE Damage + 30%`.


      With this buff, they hit much harder and are totally viable in low-
      to mid-tier PvE. In high-tier PvE you tend not to sidle up to enemies
      but that's not the fault of slug shotguns :)

          All of the reloading options are interesting in their own way, so we
          have one general set of rolls revolving around `Assault Mag` and
          `Surrounded`.

          Vorpal + Auto-Loading Holster gives you the greatest uptime in boss DPS phases.
          Add in Assault Mag for slightly higher DPS with the increased rate-of-fire, and
          Full Bore and a Range MW for the most range possible and you've got a stew
          cooking!
