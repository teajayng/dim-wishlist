    summary: >
      Bite of the Fox is a Kinetic-slot, Aggressive Frame sniper. It's been in
      the Iron Banner loot pool since Season 4 and has been re-issued in Season
      11. This means if you *had* a BOTF, it will hit the level cap this season,
      so you'll want to get a new roll to take you past Season 11.


      Aggressive Frame snipers are the only ones that can one-shot every super
      in the Crucible. Every super has a different damage-resistance tier that
      affects your ability to do that however Aggressive Frames do not care
      about such things.


      The perk pool is unchanged in the re-issue, so we have a pretty simple
      set of rolls we're chasing.
      
      
      With respect to PvE below, there's no Triple-
      Tap, Fourth Time's the Charm, Vorpal, etc. so I'd suggest you use
      something else in PvE in the Kinetic slot. If you absolutely had to have
      one, maybe [`Firmly Planted` + `Field Prep`]?

        desc: >
          This series of rolls is based around Snapshot and Accuracy-increasing
          final-column perks. After that, we're looking for as much `Range` and
          `Handling` as we can get.

          [Bite of the Fox Has a Unique "God Roll" to Farm For](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GLfGLa-oYg)
          video, here's a similar set of rolls based on `Firmly Planted`.

        desc: >
          Similar to the above set of `Firmly Planted`-based rolls, but this
          time with `Moving Target` in the final slot. Oddly, you get the
          `Accuracy` benefit of `Moving Target` without actually moving.
