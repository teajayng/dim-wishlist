    summary: >
      Crimil's is a 110 RPM Kinetic, Aggressive Frame Hand Cannon that has been
      re-issued in Season 11 with a higher power cap. It features the same perk
      pool its always had and since 110s haven't been touched over the years
      dince Destiny 2's launch, it's going to be a pretty limited set of perks
      we're interested in.


      I wouldn't call 110s the meta (far from it) or really all that
      competitive at the moment. My guess is that new perks will appear on these
      to create interesting or alternative options, because the 110s hit so hard
      it would be tough to imagine how they could otherwise make them stronger
      without unbalancing them.
      
      
      There is one niche where they **really** shine,
      and that's if you want to use them for cleanup kills after zinging someone
      with a bow or sniper body shot. They are the only Hand Cannon archetype
      where a crit can OHK-cleanup in that playstyle. In terms of 1:1 duels,
      they punish you for missing and you will not adequately flinch your
      opponents compared to ARs, 150 HCs, Pulses, etc.

          One of the rare weapons that can roll with both `Moving Target` and
          `Opening Shot` at the same time. The 110s have a punishing kick so
          after that, we're going for `Stability`.

          These two perks form the core of this roll and without them, you've
          got a slow, clunky, punishing 110 RPM HC. I mean even with them, it's
          still pretty slow and clunky. YMMV 🤪

          The 110s have low Handling because they're supposed to embody the
          "Cannon" part of "Hand Cannon". Adding Snapshot to the mix can make
          all the difference in how a 110 feels.

      The perk pool here is before the new good stuff started rolling out, so
      there's not too many surprises. The only damage-dealing perk is `Kill
      Clip` but we have a few ways to reload quickly.


      Part of the added challenge with these old weapons is that the perk
      pools are so large the chances of getting what you want is quite low.
