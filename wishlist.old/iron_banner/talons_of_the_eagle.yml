    summary: >
      Talons of the Eagle is a 150 RPM "High-Impact Frame" Kinetic Scout Rifle.
      It originally appeared wayyy back in Season 4 (aka Forsaken). It's been
      recently re-issued in the first Season 11 Iron Banner. As part of this
      re-issue, the perk pool is unchanged, so we have years' worth of knowledge
      about how these work and years' worth of confusion as to why Scout Rifles
      can roll with `Threat Detector` and `Hip-Fire Grip`.

      
      In order to beat out other long-range options in the Kinetic slot for PvP,
      I think you really want `Explosive Payload` here. 150s are the
      slowest-firing, heaviest-hitting scouts but when you're competing against
      snipers and Arbalests, I think you need more flinch than they can put out
      at base.

      
      The general drawbacks of 150s is their low `Stability` and `Handling` so
      we're going to address those as a secondary focus in all in all of our
      rolls.

          `Firmly Planted` is terrific on long-range weapons like Pulse and
          Scout Rifles where you can post up in cover and peek shoot from a
          distance. There's also not much else terrific in that slot. Zen
          Moment is good, but Firmly Planted outclasses it.

          We're going to repeat the same set of rolls that we have above, minus
          `Firmly Planted` which is a pretty big playstyle preference that some
          folks are not super keen on. It's not a make-or-break here, so we're
          also going to feature rolls without it.

      As mentioned in the PvP summary, Talons is still rocking that Season 4
      perk pool, meaning we're back to our tried-and-true combinations.
