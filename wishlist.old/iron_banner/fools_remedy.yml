    summary: >
      Fool's Remedy is "SUROS Rapid-Fire" (i.e. fully automatic) 450 RPM Sidearm
      that has been re-issued in Season 11's Iron Banner. The Remedy is the only
      SUROS-RF sidearm in the game apart from `Dead Man Walking` whose power cap
      is the current Season (11).
      
      
      If you're going to chase a single weapon from Season 11 Iron Banner (thus
      far), the Fool's Remedy is the one to go for. People are raving about it
      because of how it performs at base, its available perks, and that those
      perks now include the new Iron Banner specific perks: `Iron Gaze` and
      `Iron Grip`.

      As is pleasantly becoming the norm in Season 11, it's hard to pick a single
      "god roll" for this sidearm. We're trending towards a lack of
      unequivocally "best" rolls (or even best-per-input-type) and that's going
      to make the Destiny sandbox a lot more interesting, especially as the
      first batch of weapons sunset this season.


      We're going to proceed with these starting from the last perk and working
      our way backwards. I agree with CoolGuy that the two most important perks
      are the final columns and you build the rest of the roll around them.
      Fortunately there are so many great possibilities here, you stand a good
      chance of landing multiple rolls!

          Working backwards from `Iron Gaze` (+20 AA), we're going for as much
          `Stability` as we can. We'd end choosing the rest of the roll
          similarly if we landed `Kill Clip` or `Eye of the Storm` in the final
          slot, so we'll combine these rolls.

          some of our other columns for non-Stability enhancing perks.

      There's only one damage-boosting perk in the final column, so this will
      be a straightforward set of rolls.

          This is a weird one... we're draining the mag to get the reload
          boost from `Alloy Magazine` so we have to watch out for other
          perks that might short-circuit this way of using it.
