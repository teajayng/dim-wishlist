overview: >
  The Steady Hand (TSH) is a 120 RPM "Aggressive Frame" Kinetic Hand Cannon,
  re-issued in Year 4 with random rolls. Prior to Season 12 in November 2020,
  Aggressive Frames were bumped from 110 RPM to 120 RPM as part of a
  [large scale Hand Cannon rework](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/49676).
  The general consensus thus far is that TSH is terrific.

  What I love about these videos (and this set of perks) is that there is not
  absolute agreement on which roll is the best.
  
  
  Iron Banner weapons tend to shine in PvP, so we won't feature many PvE
  builds.

    overview: >
      With Bungie's announcement that they can now have different falloff tiers
      across Hand Cannons (see patch notes above) the 120s are, perhaps oddly,
      now able to compete with Pulse Rifles. That, plus the fact that this is a
      controller-centric wishlist, means we'll be favouring Stability and Aim
      Assist perks.


      > *You don't really need to worry about Range in my opinion so much on
      these hand cannons since they already have so much to begin with. Not to
      say it isn't valuable, but I think that it might be worth boosting other
      aspects of this weapon."* - Drewsky

          Moving Target and Iron Gaze are going to bump Target Acquisition
          immensely. You give up a few meters of damage falloff, and in return
          significantly increased accuracy.

        overview: >
          This is primarily a roll for sixes where TSH can shine as a cleanup
          weapon with a higher chance of chaining kills. Keep in mind that a
          `Resilience` of `5` cancels out the Swashbuckler two-tap from full
          health but in sixes that's not always what you're dealing with. If you
          can pair this with a ranged melee (Swashbuckler x 5) you'llI
          wouldn't suggest this roll for Comp or Trials.

          If you pair a Quickdraw TSH with a breach-load GL with a Quick Access
          Sling mod, you have a super powerful combination. Pairing it with Le
          Monarque has a similar effect: massive damage with an opening shot from
          your Energy weapon and a single shot from TSH to clean up. With
          Quickdraw and Snapshot, this Aggressive Frame can feel like a
          Lightweight.

      Generally in PvE you're going for as much `Range` as you can get with
      sustained damage upkeep. If you liked
      [The Duke Mk. 44](https://www.light.gg/db/items/2112909414/duke-mk-44/)
      then TSH could be for you.

        overview: >
          Without Outlaw, you're going to have to rely on Transversives,
          Marksman's Dodge, etc. to reload effectively in PvE. Without it,
          you're looking at a lot of downtime in situations where there are
          better alternatives. This is the case with Outlaw-based Duke rolls
