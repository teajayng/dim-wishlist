    summary: >
      Orewing's is almost identical to the
      [Truthteller](#truthteller---pvp)
      in every way, save for a much less excellent perk pool. Truthteller has
      more interesting combinations, but if you're swimming in GL's from Iron
      Banner and really want to keep one, read on.


      [Destiny Fun Police](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXhfIXnPTT4)
      (aka DFP) first popularized these back in Year 1 of Destiny 2 when he
      used the Fighting Lion to great affect.


      Like Truthteller, Orewing's is part of the "Lightweight Frame" grenade
      launchers (breach-loaded, single shot). Lightweight grenade launchers all
      have a "remote detonation" ability where they detonate when you release
      the trigger (or you get a direct hit). These weapons have a very high
      skill ceiling, allowing banked shots and shots that explode next to
      enemies in cover. In PvP, these weapons excel at starting engagements
      rather than finishing them. We want Orewing's to soften our enemies up,
      even if we don't get a direct hit.


      Let's talk perks, and why you probably want a Truthteller instead ;)

      * **Column 2**: Here you have a choice between `Spike`, `Blinding` and
      `Concussion` grenades. Blinding grenades flash your screen white and
      slowly subside whereas Concussion grenades jerk your camera dramatically,
      like being hit by a tether. Either Concussion or Blinding grenades are
      bugged because Blinding's radius is massive whereas Concussion requires
      a near direct hit. With such a wide radius, you can practically gaurantee
      that you'll be able to blind folks in PvP so I tend to suggest `Blinding`.
      What about `Promixity`? The proximity detonation radius is so miniscule
      that you may as well use `Spike` if you're that accurate. Firing at
      enemies in the Tribute Hall and you have to give them a buzz cut for
      `Proximity` to proc.

      * **Column 3**: Only one perk in this column has utility in PvP and
      that's `Quickdraw`.
      
      * **Column 4** : Only one perk in this column has utility in PvP and
      that's Auto-Loading Holster. `Rangefinder`, `Moving Target` and `Snapshot`
      don't help us at all, because you're always hip-firing. `Demolitionist`
      only procs on kills and we're using these to open, not to close. If you
      get any other perk than ALH in this slot, it will unfortunately go to
      waste.


      In the immortal words of
      [@tednaleid](https://github.com/tednaleid)
      "I'm not sure why Bungie created both of these weapons" and it's true!
      It's hard to see why you'd run an Orewing's over a Truthteller. Heck it's
      hard to see why you'd run an Orewing's at all given the two most important
      slots have near zero utility in PvP.


      Remember to pair this with the `Quick Access Sling` mod as it'll proc with
      every shot and let us more quickly clean up what we've started.

          The rest of the rolls won't feature `Quickdraw`. It's fine but with
          `Quick Access Sling` you won't miss it.

      [Have a look](#truthteller---pve)
      and come on back!


      The main difference is that the perks on Orewing's are in different
      columns, so we don't have as many choices.

          Spike grenades and some sort of reload perk, that's all we're looking
          for here.
