    summary: >
      For a moment in time, Swarm of the Raven was a legit DPS option. It's a
      Void Grenade Launcher and the buff from Tractor Cannon made it a beast.
      It's not super hot anymore, but why not secure yourself a good one just
      in case? Chances are without even trying you're going to get a pretty
      decent roll. Enjoy!
