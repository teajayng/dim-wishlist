overview: >
  Code Duello is the Season 13 Rocket Launcher. You can pick it up from chests
  in the Battlegrounds playlists and Umbral Engrams. It features a handful of
  the new S13 perks including `Impulse Amplifier`, `Frenzy` and `Lasting
  Impression`. Ehroar put together a
  [solid video review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcgBIemy83E)
  comparing them and offering some suggestions for interesting rolls. You're
  going to be drowning in these by the end of Season 13 and with the new
  damage perks, these are worth picking up!


  Yes, you can finally get rid of the curated `Bad Omens` with `Impact Casing`
  you've been holding on to for ages 😉 A decent roll below is going to now
  outclass that because of the new final-column damage perks! 💥


  Finally, definitely check out [Rustopholis]. He does super deep dives on
  Rocket Launchers, including a few that were super helpful in understanding
  how some of the new perks worked.

      Fallout has 
      [a guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iQSmF67Exk)
      hitting on `Blast Radius` and `Cluster Bombs` configuration for PvP and
      PvE. Of course, this was before the change was made that moved more of
      the damage away from the clusters. That being said, the overall thrust
      of the video still holds for PvP. For PvE with the release of the new
      damage perks, `Cluster Bombs` is no longer your pick (see below).

        overview: >
          First we start with a super high default `Blast Radius` of `95`. Then
          we sprinkle on some `Cluster Bomb` action and you've already got a
          great chance of splashing down on packs of Guardians. Add in high
          `Velocity` and improved `Handling` and you've got a snappy air raid
          in your grasp.

      Code Duello has some terrific new perks for dishing out major damage in
      a flexible way, one of which is incredibly interesting for folks soloing
      tough content.

        overview: >
          With `Lasting Impression` it's possible to stick a rocket, switch
          to another weapon and debuff the stickee (e.g. Divinity). With Auto-
          Loading Holster, by the time you switch back to Code Duello, it
          should be reloaded. Rinse and repeat! Be forewarned however, this is
          a super niche roll and not at all a run-and-gun RL. It's more for
          grins on what type of "chess" you can play with an RL in Destiny.

          This goes great with Warmind-cell builds for constantly clearing
          adds. Via Rustopholis above, note that Field Prep only checks to see
          if you're crouched at the *start* of the reload animation, not
          throughout.

        overview: >
          This is your standard "stand behind cover / in a well and chuck
          rockets at the boss" roll. Whether or not you value `Frenzy` over
          `Lasting Impression` will depend on the encounter. The barrels and
          masterworks are mostly focused on adding Handling and are gravy
          (but solid if you get them!).
