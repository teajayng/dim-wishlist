overview: >
  Bite of the Fox is a Kinetic-slot, Aggressive Frame sniper. It's been in
  the Iron Banner loot pool since Season 4 and has been re-issued in Season
  11. This means if you *had* a BOTF, it will hit the level cap this season,
  so you'll want to get a new roll to take you past Season 11.
