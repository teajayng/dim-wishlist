overview: >
  Chroma Rush is one of the many beautiful new weapons available in S14. It's
  a 720 RPM Rapid-Fire Frame Auto Rifle; the only available in the game apart
  from Arctic Haze. See how they compare
  [over on light.gg](https://www.light.gg/db/items/compare/?h=BCvcwA;BP3N0;).
  Artic Haze suffered from a punishing base recoil and a
  lack of stability and damage-dealing perks whereas Chroma has both of those
  in spades.
