# Welcome to the Sliflist!

You're probably looking for the [Sliflist website](https://sliflist.com/) website to check out rolls and learn more about how we come up with this stuff. GitHub is more for the development side of things.

# Contributing

**"I have an idea for a roll!"**

That would be awesome, thank you! We've got you [covered on the website](http://sliflist.com/docs/welcome/contributing/).

**"I'd like to enhance the generator"**

Perfect. You're in the right place... except not yet; need to update this section of the docs :)
