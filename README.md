# Welcome to the Sliflist!

You're probably looking for the [Sliflist website](https://rslifka.github.io/sliflist/) website to check out rolls and learn more about how we come up with this stuff. GitHub is more for the development side of things.

# Reference

We have a [bit of a wiki going](https://github.com/rslifka/sliflist/wiki) for the type of information we find helpful when coming up with rolls. This may eventually be moved to the website for improved browse/searchability.

# Contributing

**"I have an idea for a roll!"** That would be awesome, thank you! We've got you [covered on the website](http://rslifka.github.io/sliflist/docs/welcome/contributing/).

**"I'd like to enhance the generator"** Perfect. You're in the right place... except not yet; need to update this section of the docs :)
