# Welcome to the Sliflist!

You're probably looking for the [Sliflist website](https://rslifka.github.io/sliflist/)?

GitHub is more for the development side of things.

# Reference

We have a [bit of a wiki going](https://github.com/rslifka/sliflist/wiki) for the type of information we find helpful when coming up with rolls. This may eventually be moved to the website for improved browse/searchability.
