Check out CoolGuy's review of [Killing Wind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go1TYsXCopc&feature=youtu.be&t=420).

Here's are the benefits as he describes them:

* `Killing Wind` has a five second duration. Additional kills refresh the duration.
* It adds roughly five tiers of Mobility with the attendant benefits (strafe speed, etc.).
* It adds roughly a 4m increase in damage falloff.
* The Range boost it provides "is like a sustained version of `Opening Shot`".
* Handling increase is on par with Snapshot and vastly improved stow speed.

From the DCP "Firing Range" podcast interview with Bungie sandbox devs:

> "Killing Wind grants `+20 Mobility`, a Range and Handling bump and a strafe movement bonus that's 30% faster than `Moving Target`.
