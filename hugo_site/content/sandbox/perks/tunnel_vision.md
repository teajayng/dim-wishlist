Check out [Fallout's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pXZXEMdwuY&t=442s) timestamped to start of `Tunnel Vision` testing.

_**Tunnel Vision** - Reloading after defeating a target greatly increases target acquisition and aim down sight speed for a short duration._

* ADS improvement is a "minor bump"; definitely not `Shapshot`.
* Slightly widens your Aim Assist (i.e. bullet magnetism) cone giving you a more generous area of where any bullet you shoot can hit.
* Duration of 5s.
* Does not stack.

From the DCP "Firing Range" podcast; an interview with Bungie sandbox leads:

> Tunnel Vision grants `+20 Aim Assist`, `+20 Accuracy` and also a small multiplier to auto aim and magnetism cone angles
