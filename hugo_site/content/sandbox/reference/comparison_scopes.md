`Zoom` has a multiplicative effect on `Range` so while the difference between (for example) no modifier and a `+5` might seem like a small number, it makes quite a difference in how constrained the view is when zooming in. This also means smaller controller/mouse movements map to larger movements, just like when zooming in with a camera. This is, along with many choices when dealing with weapons and armor, entirely up to you and your play style. There is no "right" scope to pick for all players in all situations.
