*6/26/2020 - This section is nascent; needs a lot of work. Unfortunately not a ton of bow 'science' out there, so this will be slow going.*

* **`Draw Time`** Is the one unique stat for bows.
  * Every twenty points in Draw Time equates to 0.03 seconds, or one frame at 30fps.
  * `Lightweight` bows are the fastest and have a floor of 540ms (i.e. any decrease beyond this will not take affect).
  * It does not affect Bow impact in the way that `Charge Time` affects Fusion Rifle impact.
