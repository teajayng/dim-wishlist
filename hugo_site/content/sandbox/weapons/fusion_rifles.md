*This is primarily a transcription of Castle's amazing video that you should watch post haste. ["Nobody Understands THIS about Fusion Rifles..."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3jOck_kTZA) - [Castle Content](https://www.youtube.com/c/CastleContent)*

Since D1, I've greatly enjoyed Fusion Rifles as they're one of the most unique weapons Destiny has to offer. They're also pretty darn confusing to reason about. Now that fusions have been completely reworked and rebalanced during Season 15, it's time to forget most of what I knew and dive back in. 

## Archetypes

In Destiny 2, some behaviour was included by default on weapons and changed to the idea of a "Frame" which you may also hear referred as an "Intrinsic Perk".

|Frame|Description|Bolts (To Kill)|Damage|Charge Time|
|:-|:-|:-:|:-:|-:|
|High-Impact|Slow-firing and high-damage. This weapon is more accurate when stationary and aiming down sights.|5 (4)|62|1000ms|
|Precision|This weapon's recoil pattern is more predictably vertical.|7 (5)|40|740ms|
|Adaptive|A well-rounded grip, reliable and sturdy.|7 (5)|39|660ms|
|Rapid-Fire|Deeper ammo reserves. Slightly faster reload when magazine is empty.|9 (7)|29|460ms|

## Stat Preferences

From the Fusion Rifle rework TWAB:

  * High-Impact: Less reliant on `Stability`, can stack a bit more `Range`.
  * Rapid-Fire: More reliant on `Stability`, less reliant on `Range`.

Since these are at opposite ends of the frame spectrums, presuambly we can fill in the blanks for the intermediate frames.

## Charge Time and Damage Changes

This has long been a source of confusion for me so here's deal for now.

|Type|Name|Charge Time|Damage|
|-|-|-|-|
|Perk|Accelerated Coils|-40ms|-2%|
|Perk|Liquid Coils|+40ms|+2%|
|Perk|Backup Plan|-30%|-20%|
|Masterwork|Charge Time|-40ms|-2%|
|Mod|Charge Time|-40ms|**NO CHANGE!**|
