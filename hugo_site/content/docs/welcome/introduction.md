To the 👈 you'll find our roll catalog, organized by where or when the weapon drops. Bungie is always expanding the world loot pool, and to ease confusion, that's been extracted into a separate category. Seasons contain only the season-specific set of weapons.

Once viewing a roll, to the 👉 you'll find shortcuts to specific rolls or groupings (for example, PvP).

To the 👆 you'll find the search bar, which is probably the quickest way to find what you're looking for.

## I Have an Idea for a Roll!

AMAZING, let's hear it!

## I Noticed a Typo, Roll Error, Etc.

Sweet, [open an issue](https://github.com/rslifka/sliflist/issues) and let us know where the problem is!

## Season 12 is Missing 🐥

Yes, Season 12 or "The Forgotten Season" as we sometimes refer to it. Season of the Hunt dropped alongside Beyond Light with more story exposition than interesting new weapons or activities. None of the weapons stood out in a way that got Sliflist authors stoked enough to create rolls. [Deafening Whisper](https://d2gunsmith.com/w/981718087) is a solid GL and paired well with [Warmind's Decree](https://www.light.gg/db/items/282898303/warminds-decree/) in Season 14, so perhaps we'll circle back around and add some rolls.

Or you could submit some yourself!
