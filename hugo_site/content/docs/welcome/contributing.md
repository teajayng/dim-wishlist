There are two ways to contribute to the Sliflist.

## 1 - Suggest / Tweak Rolls

Roll philosophy and format is discussed over in ["What's in a Roll?"]({{< ref "roll_format" >}}).

## 2 - Improve the Sliflist Itself

To see about contributing to the codebase that creates the wishlist and generates this site, head over to [@rslifka/sliflist](https://github.com/rslifka/sliflist).
