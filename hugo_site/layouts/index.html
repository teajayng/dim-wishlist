        <p>
          Wouldn't it be awesome if someone kept up to date on the state of the Destiny <a href="https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/259365/what-is-the-sandbox">sandbox</a>, watched all the weapon testing and review videos so you didn't have to? And then they went and created a whole bunch of rolls to get you started and keep your vault clean??
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The Sliflist's goal is to do just that</strong>: to tell you when a related set of perks come together to make an interesting roll. If you're putting in decent hours, using DIM and looking up custom wishlists, you likely have a pretty chonky vault. The Sliflist generally has a pretty high bar so that we're only keeping the good stuff. As the wishlist is updated, so are the <a href="{{ ref . "introduction" }}">thoughts that go in to each roll</a>.
        </p>
        <h5>"My weapon has <code>Kill Clip</code> on it. That's a great perk; why doesn't the Sliflist tell me to keep it?"</h5>
        <p>
          With the exception of <code>Adrenaline Junkie</code> ðŸ™ƒ a case can be made for nearly every Destiny perk in isolation. This is part of what makes Destiny so fun! You don't need a DIM wishlist to tell you that <code>Kill Clip</code> is a decent perk; you already know that. The Sliflist isn't trying to tell you every possible perk that might happen to be good in isolation. It's attempting to highlight perk combos that play off of each other or that make a solid roll even better.
        </p>
        <h5>"But it's [insert great perk here]! Are you SURE it's not a good roll?"</h5>
        <p>
          I know, I know, some perks seem too good to part with. Remember though, your vault space is limited: the more in it, the less likely you use any of it; you simply have too much to choose from so you end up utilizing only a small set of what you have. Pro-tip: this phenomenon is known as "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisficing">satisficing</a>". Are you ever about to load in to an activity and just throw on whatever is handy because you have 192 energy weapons? Welcome to <em>satisficing</em>!
        </p>
        <h5>"A hip-fire slug shotgun? Are you joking? Why would this be highlighted?"</h5>
        <p>
          A secondary objective is indicate which rolls, even if they aren't the "meta", would be interesting to use in both PvE and PvP. When <code>Hip-Fire Grip</code> was buffed, it was totally possible to reasonably hip-fire <code>First In, Last Out</code>. The chances of anyone <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj1tNWkP9Fg">maining that roll</a> are basically none, but maybe it's just fun to play with for a bit?
        </p>
        <h5>"Sliflist?"</h5>
        <p>
          It was initially called "wishlist". Someone jokingly referred to it as "The Sliflist" and it stuck ðŸ¤·

        <h1 class="display-4 mt-0 text-center">Who Made This?</h1>
        <p>
          A few of us over on the Disco Technical Destiny Slack. Many of us have been around since 2014, all of us have been playing for some time, are pretty geeky about the Destiny sandbox and take our gear talk wayyy too seriously.
        </p>
        <h5>"You all wrote out all these rolls and thoughts?"</h5>
        <p>
          Yep! 
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, we're heavily influenced by the well-known Destiny content creators who focus on sandbox analysis. They may have reviewed a weapon and shared specific insights as to why and how a particular roll could be effective. Perhaps they published content about how the sandbox itself functions. It's likely that every roll of every weapon was at least in part influenced by their work. In some cases, we've captured rolls straight out of video analysis and have credited the authors inline.
        </p>
        <h5>"Sounds like they know their stuff. Got any links?"</h5>
        <p>Sure do! This is just a sampling of folks. They're a great starting point if you're interested in learning more about the sandbox.</p>
