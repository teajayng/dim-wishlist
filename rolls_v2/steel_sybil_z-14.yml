    summary: >
      The Steel Sybil is a re-issue of the Crucible sword from the launch of
      Forsaken back in Season 4. The perks are the same as they've always been
      so unfortunately this Season (Season 11) will be about (re?)chasing your
      best roll from the past nearly two years. Whomp whomp.


      Fortunately the perk set is very small and chances are you'll get the
      roll you're after relatively quickly? When you do, rejoice! That roll
      will keep you all the way through Season 14.


      "But Slif, Falling Guillotine is void and is way better DPS. Why would I
      keep a Steel Sybil around?" Great question, let's turn it over to Joe:

      > Futureproofing if they better differentiate the role of the two frames.
      But given the small sword perk pool, it's never really been hard to
      scrounge up a serviceable weapon at the time you need it. I'd imagine
      guillotine will become better for wide damage, sybil better for single
      target. But as of today, you only need guillotine.


      Note that swords only have one possible Masterwork (Impact) hence the
      appearance of "any MW will do" in the wishlist; which isn't really the
      case :)

          With Whirlwind and Relentless you'll be slicing for what seems like
          forever. C/o
          [this analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/a2mjez/sword_awareness_1_jagged_edge_vs_honed_edge/),
          Jagged Edge is the clear choice for the first column, but you'll want
          to make sure your reserves are increased in armor. Heavy Guard
          sacrifices Charge Rate and massive increased all the other important
          sword stats, but that's fine because Charge Rate is such a compressed
          stat you won't notice the difference.

          Same as the CE, minus Heavy Guard. That's OK because you won't be
          doing all that much defending while slicing away with your sword.

          You really only need these two to do phenomenal amounts of sustained
          damage and fortunately they're pretty easy to find!
