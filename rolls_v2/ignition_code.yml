  > *The most important weapon to get this season that will be relevant in
  the PvE meta for some time"* - [Ehroar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk53lvImHRU)


  > *This thing is horrifying. It's going to remind you of The Mountaintop
  It's like a full-auto GL!* - [Frostbolt](https://youtu.be/jJFV_4Y6p7s)


  Well, I'm not sure the world of players will get as much utility out of this
  in PvP as Frostbolt does, but you will definitely make magic with it inside of
  PvE. If there's one Splicer weapon you farm for this season, make it the
  Ignition Code.

    overview: >
      There seems to be a new PvP meta emerging / has emerged using GLs to
      "prime" (i.e. do a material amount of damage to you) and then finish you
      off with a high-impact/low-RoF primary. It's been the case for a couple
      of seasons by now, but I'm seeing it more now that Ignition Code is so
      easy to get.

          You'll notice that we're looking to lower `Blast Radius` to ensure
          that we concentrate as much of the damage as possible on to the
          direct hit (v. splash). `Slideshot` is absolutely brilliant once you
          get the timing right. Check out some

    name: PvE
    overview: >
      Ignition Code is the only obtaininable Kinetic GL in the game that can
      roll with `Blinding Grenades` which, if you're planning on doing anything
      remotely resembling challenging PvE content, is a must-have.
      Ehroar put together a
      [solid review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk53lvImHRU)
      of Ignotion Code in PvE.

        name: Add Clear - Ehroar's Pick
        overview:
          Combining the new `Danger Zone` perk with `Blinding Grenades` means
          you're practically blinding an entire room each time you fire it.
          Absolutely top-tier for challenging PvE content. Without `Slideshot`
          you're stil looking at a phenomenal Grenade Launcher, so a handful
          of variants are offered without it.

          base:
            barrels: [Volatile Launch]

        name: Single-Target Damage - Ehroar's Pick
        overview:
          This roll is centered around the damage bosts from `Spike Grenades`
          and `Vorpal Weapon`. Again we're looking to minimize Blast Radius and
          keep the damage focused on the point of contact. Without `Slideshot`
          you're stil looking at a phenomenal Grenade Launcher, so a handful
          of variants are offered without it.
