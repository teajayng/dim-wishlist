    summary: >
      Honor's Edge (HE) is available in the World Drops loot pool in Season 11,
      originally being re-issued back in Season 10. The main difference between
      HE and SS14 is that HE can roll with `Surrounded` and `Flash Counter`,
      two both amazing perks.


      * `Surrounded` + `Surrounded Spec` ends up giving you a massive 35%
      damage increase and since a Sword is in-your-face there's a high chance
      you'll proc this regularly.

      * `Flash Counter` not only disorients but 
      [applies a 20% debuff](https://youtu.be/b9HcFqLdlyQ?t=1477)!
      This means
      *all incoming damange* is upped by 20%. You can imagine how helpful this
      would be in Public Events (like the S11 Contact event), to debuff the
      boss with up to eleven other Guardians attacking. The debuff lasts for
      five seconds, so you'll need to periodically switch to blocking for this
      to take effect. Given that every boss in the game stomps, this is a great
      way to take out your anti-stomp rage 😡



      Fortunately the perk set is very small and chances are you'll get the
      roll you're after relatively quickly? When you do, rejoice! That roll
      will keep you all the way through Season 13.


      *Note that swords only have one possible Masterwork (Impact) hence the
      appearance of "any MW will do" in the wishlist; which isn't really the
      case*

          With Surrounded up, you'll be mowing through hordes of adds in no
          time.

          [this analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/a2mjez/sword_awareness_1_jagged_edge_vs_honed_edge/),
          Jagged Edge is the clear choice for the first column, but you'll want
          to make sure your reserves are increased in armor. Heavy Guard
          sacrifices Charge Rate and massive increased all the other important
          sword stats, but that's fine because Charge Rate is such a compressed
          stat you won't notice the difference.

          Same as the CE, minus Heavy Guard. That's OK because you won't be
          doing all that much defending while slicing away with your sword.

          You really only need these two to do phenomenal amounts of 
          damage and fortunately they're pretty easy to find!

          `Flash Counter` is akin to parrying in many games, where a perfectly
          timed block will stagger your attacker. Same set of rolls as above,
          but with `Flash Counter` in the final column.

          Baseline `Guard Efficiency` is pretty awful, but if you're able to
          time it right, you won't have to keep it up for long so maybe you're
          OK with it?
