overview: >
  The Glacioclasm is a High-Impact Frame Fusion Rifle released for the first
  time in The Dawning, 2020 (Y4 S12). Implicit in the High-Impact frames are
  that you gain accuracy while crouched: "more accurate when stationary and
  aiming down sights".

  
  Here are some highlights called out from
  [CoolGuy's review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcKyglpE5UI):

    * Base 1.6 Zoom, versus 1.5 on all other Fusions
    * Best Handling and Stability of all High-Impact Frames
    * Base Range of `67`, "Already at the cap; you don't need any more. It's
    near perfect for the Range that fusions have right now [after the range
    compression nerf]."

  From
  [Fallout's Review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7URG6BUl_Q),
  the difference between a "low range" (67) and "high range" (89) setup is that
  you gain a single meter before falloff, from 17-18m. That's likely why CoolGuy
  and Fallout suggest investing in Stability.

    overview: >
      As mentioned above, the Glacioclasm's base stats are some of the best
      ever for a High-Impact frame. Because of this, we can narrow our focus on
      perks and go for some amazing rolls in a post-Erentil world. This is a
      controller wishlist and so these rolls will primarily focus on
      `Stability` (which is probably also fine for M&K but apparently M&K
      players aren't into Fusions as much?)


      I
      [put together a chart](https://github.com/rslifka/wishlist/wiki/Weapon-Focus-Fusion-Rifles)
      from Fallout's video above and after some helpful Guardians let me voop
      'em in a private match.

        name: Accelerated Four-Bolter
        overview: >
          This roll is based around the combination of `Accelerated Coils` and
          `High-Impact Reserves`. This will allow you to four-bolt Guardians at
          `9` Resilience with two in the mag (i.e. when you spawn in). I have
          no Resilience statistics, but checked across three games last night
          and most people were `2`-`3` with a few around `5`. If you happen to
          get `Chambered Compensator` be sure to throw on a Counterbalance mod
          to hit `Recoil:100`.

        name: Stable Four-Bolter
        overview: >
          Similar to the above, swapping in `Particle Repeater` to replace
          `Accelerated Coils`, but still centering around `High-Impact
          Reserves`. Because the Charge Time is slower you can now four-bolt
          Guardians at any `Resilience` value.

        name: Jittery Four-Bolter
        overview: >
          There is a unique situation among rolls here that's super interesting.
          If you have a `Charge Time` Masterwork and `High-Impact Reserves` it
          means you can four-bolt Guardians at `6` Resilience with two in the
          mag. That's actually a downgrade from not having a `Charge Time`
          Masterwork... but(!) you get an upgrade with one in the mag in that
          you can now four-bolt Guardians with **any** Resilience.
        perks: 
          base: 
            barrels: [Arrowhead Brake, Chambered Compensator]
            magazines: [Particle Repeater]

        name: Slow and Steady Four-Bolter
        overview: >
          This roll is based around `Liquid Coils`, which allows you to
          four-bolt Guardians at `9` Resilience. The introduction of `Liquid
          Coils` opens this roll up quite a bit. You won't find a `Charge Time`
          Masterwork here because it would drop the roll down to `6` Resilience.
        perks: 
          base:

        overview: >
          The base stats on Glacioclasm are rock solid are terrific. This roll
          captures the remainder of good rolls that do not include Coil-
          modifying magazines and/or High-Impact Reserves.
