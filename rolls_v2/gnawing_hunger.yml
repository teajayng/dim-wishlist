overview: >
  Gnawing Hunger is a 600 RPM "Adaptive Frame" Energy Auto Rifle first
  introduced in Season 6. It has been reissued in Season 11, meaning it will be
  capable of going up to the Season 14 power level cap. Adaptives were buffed
  Season 10 and unless something changes, will remain very strong through Season
  11.

      using the generally agreed-upon "God roll" roll with `Tap the Trigger`,
      `Kill Clip` and a Stability Masterwork.

      > "Is there a bug with this gun or is it just really good? I feel like I'm killing too fast right now... like a little bit too fast. I don't get it."


      > "This... it feels better than Summoner and SUROS. I can't believe there's a weapon like this in the game and I didn't know about it. I've never seen something like this."


      > "Dude what is this TTK? I don't get it! This TTK is a little too fast Bungie."

      
      I hopped in to the Tribute Hall and ran several Recoil pattern tests
      with various Barrels, Magazines, Perks and Masterworks (Arrowhead, Steady
      Rounds, Tap the Trigger, etc.). At base Stability and Recoil (on console
      at least), it's pretty hard to control.
      
      
      There are two ways to get Gnawing Hunger to hone in for you:
      
      1. **Tap the Trigger**: The most noticeable difference in bullet
      concentration comes from TtT. If you want a laser beam, you want TtT. That
      being said, if you *only* get TtT and no other Stability or Recoil perks,
      it's not nearly as easy to control as it could be.

      2. **Arrowhead + Counterbalance**: This combo *absolutely works* as well.
      I was
      able to cluster rounds around small targets just fine, without TtT. If
      you don't get Zen Moment or Tap the Trigger in the third column, but you
      do get Arrowhead Brake in the first column, you might find it totally
      capable, especially if you're on PC.
      

      What you **really** want is to slam all these perks together for maximum
      Stability and minimal Recoil, and that's what we're going to break down
      below.

          Going for as much `Recoil` and `Stability` improvement as we can get.
          `Kill Clip` is phenomenal on the Gnawing Hunger, bumping your optimal

    summary: >
      With `Subsistence` getting a buff, it is the go-to perk in column three.
      `Overflow` is there, but only as part of the curated roll which hasn't
      been available since Reckoning was retired.

          As much Range as we can get from everywhere we can get it. We're
          combining Subsistence with Swashbuckler or Rampage because those two
          (versus the two kill clips) can be refreshed/extended without
          reloading.
